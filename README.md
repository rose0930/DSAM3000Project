# Philosophy-of-Science-Canon
Welcome to my DSAM 3000 project!

The aim is to track the proportion of women philosophers publishing in Philosophy of Science from 1960-2020.
The sources are journal articles published in Philosophy of Science, drawn from the journal's archives at Cambridge University Press.
