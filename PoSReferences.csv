J,"Isaac, AMC",,,,"Isaac, Alistair M. C.",,,Epistemic Loops and Measurement Realism,PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Recent philosophy of measurement has emphasized the existence of both diachronic and synchronic loops, or feedback processes, in the epistemic achievements of measurement. A widespread response has been to conclude that measurement outcomes do not convey interest-independent facts about the world and that only a coherentist epistemology of measurement is viable. In contrast, I argue that a form of measurement realism is consistent with these results. The insight is that antecedent structure in measuring spaces constrains our empirical procedures such that successful measurement conveys a limited but veridical knowledge of fixed points, or modally stable, interest-independent features of the world.","[Isaac, Alistair M.

In his account, McGrew demonstrates that, ceteris paribus, a hypothesis that unifies its evidence will have a higher posterior probability than a hypothesis that does not. Myrvold, on the other hand, offers a specific measure of unification that can be applied to individual hypotheses. He argues that one. must account for this measure in order to calculate correctly the degree of confirmation that a hypothesis receives from its evidence. Using the probability calculus, I prove that the two accounts of unification require the same underlying inequality; thus, McGrew and Myrvold have accounted for unification in fundamentally identical probabilistic terms. I then evaluate five putative counterexamples to this account and show that these examples, far from disqualifying it, serve to clarify our notion of unification by disentangling it from a host of other concepts.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Schupbach, JN (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, 1017 Cathedral Learning, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",jns24@pitt.edu,,"Schupbach, Jonah/0000-0002-8998-7352",,,,,5,17,21,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

The two opposite views are widely known as endurantism (or three-dimensionalism) and perdurantism (four-dimensionalism). According to the former, objects are extended in three spatial dimensions and persist through time by being wholly present at any moment at which they exist. On the rival account, objects are extended both in space and time and persist by having temporal parts, no Dart being present at more than one time. Relativistic considerations seem highly relevant to this debate, But they have played little role in it so far. This paper seeks to remedy that situation.

While Sober's causal approach has the potential to reveal new insights, I argue that his setup fails to capture important aspects of the multiple realizability thesis. After correcting for these issues, I argue that this causal framework reveals something quite different. It reveals how multiple realizability relates to a common type of causal complexity in biology that poses problems for reductive explanation.","[Ross, Lauren N.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Log & Philosophy Sci, 3151 Social Sci Plaza A, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Ross, LN (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Log & Philosophy Sci, 3151 Social Sci Plaza A, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",,,"Ross, Lauren N./0000-0003-0771-7189",,,,,38,7,9,1,6,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Although he regarded them as formally equivalent, a re-analysis of his own argument for their equivalence brings out two important assumptions on which it rests: weak additivity and actor's control. When weak additivity breaks down, neither fitness concept is appropriate in its original form. When actor's control breaks down, neighbor-modulated fitness may be appropriate, but inclusive fitness is not.

A prominent argument (due to Hardin, among others) proposes to eliminate colors as real, objective properties of objects, on grounds that nothing in the external world (and especially not surface-reflectance- profiles) answers to the well-known and quite determinate internal structure of human phenomenological color space. The present paper proposes a novel way to construe the objective space of possible reflectance profiles so that (1) its internal structure becomes evident, and (2) that structure's homomorphism with the internal structure of human phenomenological color space becomes obvious. The path is thus reopened to salvage the objective reality of colors, in the same way that we preserved the objective reality of such features as temperature, pitch, and sourness - by identifying them with some objective feature recognized in modern physical theory.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Philosophy, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Churchland, P (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Philosophy, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",pchurchland@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,11,30,36,0,6,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Whether selection and drift can be thought of as causally distinct, I argue, depends on the source of probabilities in natural selection.

Quantum entanglement is responsible for such features of quantum mechanics as holism, the failure of supervenience, and emergence. While I agree with these claims, I will argue that it is only part of the story. Quantum mechanics provides us with thoroughgoing reductionist explanations. I will distinguish two kinds of microexplanation (or micro-'reduction'). I will argue that even though quantum entanglement provides an example of the failure of one kind of microexplanation, it does not affect the other.

But these two theses are difficult to reconcile. Merely embracing an epistemic antireductionism will not suffice, as both reductionists and antireductionists accept that given our cognitive interests and limitations, non-molecular explanations may not be improved, corrected or grounded in molecular ones. Moreover, antireductionists themselves view their claim as a metaphysical or ontological one about the existence of facts molecular biology cannot identify, express or explain. However, this is tantamount to a rejection of physicalism and so causes the antireductionist discomfort. In this paper we argue that vindicating physicalism requires a physicalistic account of the principle of natural selection, and we provide such an account. The most important payoff to the account is that it provides for the very sort of autonomy from the physical that antireductionists need without threatening their commitment to physicalism.","Duke Univ, Ctr Philosophy Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University,"Rosenberg, A (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Ctr Philosophy Biol, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",alexrose@duke.edu,,"Kaplan, David/0000-0001-7532-1114",,,,,42,18,20,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Against the first claim, I show that many examples used to bolster it are actually instances of application of the very same classical theory rather than disjoint theories. Thus, there is a hidden unity to the world of classical physics that is usually overlooked (by, for example, Nancy Cartwright who argues for the claims above). Against the second claim, I show that the practice of classical physics involves an enormous (infinite) number of models the use of which cannot be written off as merely ad hoc. Thus, although classical physics cannot, of course, model every situation in nature, it has a much larger domain than some would have us believe.","Metropolitan State Coll Denver, Dept Philosophy, Denver, CO 80217 USA",,"Smith, SR (corresponding author), Metropolitan State Coll Denver, Dept Philosophy, Campus Box 49,POB 173362, Denver, CO 80217 USA.",,,,,,,,8,5,8,0,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Her strategy is to examine a recent episode in experimental microbiology-the case of the mistaken discovery of a bacterial organelle called a 'mesosome'-with an eye to showing how experimenters effectively used robust experimental reasoning (or could have used robust reasoning) to refute the existence of the mesosome. My plan is to criticize Culp's assessment of the mesosome episode and to cast doubt on the epistemic significance of robustness. In turn, I present a different account of the experimental reasoning microbiologists used in arriving at the conclusion that mesosomes are artifacts. I call this form of reasoning 'reliable process reasoning', and close the paper with a brief discussion of how experimental microbiologists justify the claim that an experimental process is reliable.","Concordia Univ, Dept Philosophy, Montreal, PQ, Canada",Concordia University - Canada,"Hudson, RG (corresponding author), 8 Doncaster Ave, London, ON N6G 2A2, Canada.",,,,,,,,25,18,28,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 SOUTH WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637-1603 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Once that assumption is removed, his other criteria for defining simultaneity are also satisfied by membership in the same backward (forward) null cone of the family of such cones with vertices on an inertial path. What is then unique about the Poincare-Einstein convention is that it is independent of the choice of inertial path in a given inertial frame, confirming a remark in Einstein 1905. Similarly, what is unique about the backward (forward) null cone definition is that it is independent of the state of motion of an observer at a point on the inertial path.","Univ Texas, Dept Philosophy, Austin, TX 78712 USA; Boston Univ, Dept Phys, Boston, MA 02215 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin; Boston University,"Sarkar, S (corresponding author), Univ Texas, Dept Philosophy, Waggener Hall 316, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",,,,,,,,25,27,29,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

This view of model-building has motivated a family of confirmation schemes based on the convergence of prediction and observation. This paper considers how chaotic dynamics blocks the convergence view of confirmation and has forced experimentalists to take a different approach to model-building. A method known as phase space reconstruction not only reveals a lacuna in the philosophical literature on models, it also fails to conform to conventional views about how models are used to confirm a theory.","Saginaw Valley State Univ, Dept Philosophy, University Ctr, MI 48710 USA",Saginaw Valley State University,"Koperski, J (corresponding author), Saginaw Valley State Univ, Dept Philosophy, 7400 Bay Rd, University Ctr, MI 48710 USA.",,"Koperski, Jeffrey/B-1325-2009","Koperski, Jeffrey/0000-0002-9249-7311",,,,,32,10,12,0,3,PHILOSOPHY SCI ASSN,E LANSING,"MICHIGAN STATE UNIV-DEPT PHIL 18 MORRILL HALL, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

However, this presents a problem for those who accept the Logical Positivist conception of law and its essential role in scientific explanation. I address this problem by arguing that the contingent regularities of evolutionary biology have a limited range of nomic necessity and a limited range of explanatory power even though they lack the unlimited projectibility that has been seen by some as a hallmark of scientific laws.","Duke Univ, Dept Philosophy, Durham, NC 27708 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Zool, Durham, NC 27708 USA",Duke University; Duke University,"Brandon, RN (corresponding author), Duke Univ, Dept Philosophy, Durham, NC 27708 USA.",,,,,,,,19,65,79,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

These arguments have been challenged by Sober (1991). I address some of the questions about the rational reconstruction of biology that are suggested by these arguments: What is the relation between life and the ''signs of life''? What work (if any) might the concept of ''life'' (over and above the ''signs of life'') perform in biology? What turns on scientific disputes over the utility of this concept? To defend my answers to these questions, I compare ''life'' to certain other concepts used in science, and I examine historical episodes in which an entity's vitality was invoked to explain certain phenomena. I try to understand how these explanations could be illuminating even though they are not accompanied by any reductive definition of ''life.''",,,"Lange, M (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF LOS ANGELES,DEPT PHILOSOPHY,BOX 95145,LOS ANGELES,CA 90095, USA.",,,"Lange, Marc/0000-0002-0704-7376",,,,,29,24,27,0,15,PHILOSOPHY SCI ASSN,E LANSING,"MICHIGAN STATE UNIV-DEPT PHIL 18 MORRILL HALL, E LANSING, MI 48824",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

In order to maximize their chances of meeting their objectives, however, SBMI searches must be guided by theory about the target phenomena. They correspond to strategy-driven experiments as defined by Koray Karaca, in contrast to Friedrich Steinle's conception of explorative experiments. A concept of type II safeness is proposed to explain how the objectives of the experiment introduce theory dependence in the search strategy.

Although this view is rarely made explicit, it is often assumed in philosophy and biology.

Despite the extent of the computation, however, there is very little true simulation. Simple computation is a form of theory articulation, whereas true simulation is analogous to an experimental procedure. Successful computation is faithful to an underlying mathematical model, whereas successful simulation directly mimics a process or a system. The computer is seen as a legitimate tool in economics only when traditional analytical solutions cannot be derived, i.e., only as a purely computational aid. We argue that true simulation is seldom practiced because it does not fit the conception of understanding inherent in mainstream economics. According to this conception, understanding is constituted by analytical derivation from a set of fundamental economic axioms. We articulate this conception using the concept of economists' perfect model. Since the deductive links between the assumptions and the consequences are not transparent in 'bottom-up' generative microsimulations, microsimulations cannot correspond to the perfect model and economists do not therefore consider them viable candidates for generating theories that enhance economic understanding.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Social & Moral Philosophy, SF-00014 Helsinki, Finland; Univ Helsinki, Dept Philosophy, SF-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki; University of Helsinki,"Lehtinen, A (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Social & Moral Philosophy, POB 9, SF-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",aki.lehtinen@helsinki.fi; jaakko.kuorikoski@helsinki.fi,"; Lehtinen, Aki/M-1739-2013","Lehtinen, Aki/0000-0003-0904-1071; Kuorikoski, Jaakko/0000-0001-5676-717X;",,,,,70,47,66,0,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Despite its importance this thesis generally is either simply assumed or is supported by very general arguments with heavy reliance on examples, and crucial notions involved are characterized only loosely. Yet for both philosophical analysis and practicing science, it is important to get clear about whether invariance under intervention is or is not necessary or sufficient for which kinds of causal claims. Furthermore, we need to know what counts as an intervention and what invariance is. In this paper I offer explicit definitions of two different kinds for the notions intervention, invariance, and causal correctness. Then, given some natural and relatively uncontroversial assumptions, I prove two distinct sets of theorems showing that invariance is indeed a mark of causality when the concepts are appropriately interpreted.","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Philosophy Log & Sci Method, London WC2A 2AE, England; Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Philosophy, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science; University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Cartwright, N (corresponding author), Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Philosophy Log & Sci Method, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",,,,,,,,15,21,25,0,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

J,"Vickers, JM",,,,"Vickers, JM",,,"Logic, probability, and coherence",PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"How does deductive logic constrain probability? This question is difficult for subjectivistic approaches, according to which probability is just strength of (prudent) partial belief, for this presumes logical omniscience. This paper proposes that the way in which probability lies always between possibility and necessity can be made precise by exploiting a minor theorem of de Finetti: In any finite set of propositions the expected number of truths is the sum of the probabilities over the set. This is generalized to apply to denumerable languages. It entails that the sum of probabilities can neither exceed nor be exceeded by the cardinalities of all consistent and closed (within the set) subsets. In general any numerical function on sentences is said to be logically coherent if it satisfies this condition. Logical coherence allows the relativization of necessity: A function p on a language is coherent with respect to the concept T of necessity iff there is no set of sentences on which the sum of p exceeds or is exceeded by the cardinality of every T-consistent and T-closed (within the set) subset of the set. Coherence is easily applied as well to sets on which the sum of p does not converge. Probability should also be relativized by necessity: A T-probability assigns one to every T-necessary sentence and is additive over disjunctions of pairwise T-incompatible sentences. Logical T-coherence is then equivalent to T-probability: All and only T-coherent functions are T-probabilities.","Claremont Grad Univ, Dept Philosophy, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Claremont Graduate University,"Vickers, JM (corresponding author), Claremont Grad Univ, Dept Philosophy, 736 N Coll Ave, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",John.Vickers@cgu.edu,,,,,,,30,0,0,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

The importance Duhem was later to ascribe to Aristotelian ideas as reflected in the weight he attached to medieval science is well known. But the Aristotelian influence on his own mature philosophical perspective, and more particularly on his concern for logical coherence and the development of his ontological views, is not generally acknowledged. There are, however, clear pointers in this direction in these two earlier books on the history of science, which are unashamedly written in such a way as to project the author's own view of what is important in the relevant areas. Thermodynamics was the pinnacle of Duhemian science, and its interpretation requires the reinstatement, in Duhem's view, of Aristotelian conceptions which have been unfashionable since the rise of certain ideas with the scientific revolution of the seventeenth century. The present paper is not primarily an exposition of these Aristotelian views of Duhem's, but an attempt to pursue the interpretation of a macroscopic, thermodynamical perspective on chemical substances from an elementary viewpoint in the spirit of Duhem (1902), sometimes being more definite than Duhem seems to be, and occasionally taking issue with him on certain points. Some of his leading ideas will determine the general approach, but views and problems will also be taken from modern textbooks in an attempt to lay down the general lines along which an explicit ontology-in Quine's sense-of macroscopic theory might be developed.",,,"Needham, P (corresponding author), UNIV STOCKHOLM,DEPT PHILOSOPHY,S-10691 STOCKHOLM,SWEDEN.",,,,,,,,14,6,7,0,2,PHILOSOPHY SCI ASSN,E LANSING,"MICHIGAN STATE UNIV-DEPT PHIL 18 MORRILL HALL, E LANSING, MI 48824",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Building on recent influential work by Jeremy Butterfield, I provide precise definitions of emergence concepts as they pertain to properties represented in models, applying them to some basic examples from space-time and thermostatistical physics. The chief formal innovation I employ, similarity structure, consists in a structured set of similarity relations among those models under analysis-and their properties-and is a generalization of topological structure. Although motivated from physics, this similarity-structure-based account of emergence applies to any science that represents its possibilia with (mathematical) models.","[Fletcher, Samuel C.] Univ Minnesota, 831 Heller Hall,271 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Fletcher, SC (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, 831 Heller Hall,271 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",scfletch@umn.edu,,,,,,,38,4,4,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Epiphenomenalists have offered responses that do not grasp its full depth. I thus offer a new reading and assessment of James's objection. Our life-essential, phenomenal pleasures and pains have three features that suggest that they were shaped by selection, according to James: they are natively patterned, those patterns are systematically linked with antecedent brain states, and the patterns are universal among humans. If epiphenomenalism were true, phenomenal patterns could not have been selected (because epiphenomenalism precludes phenomenal consciousness affecting reproductive success). So epiphenomenalism is likely false.","[Klein, Alexander] McMaster Univ, Univ Hall 310A,1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada",McMaster University,"Klein, A (corresponding author), McMaster Univ, Univ Hall 310A,1280 Main St West, Hamilton, ON L8S 4K1, Canada.",kleina7@mcmaster.ca,"Klein, Alexander/KBQ-6003-2024",,US-UK Fulbright Commission,US-UK Fulbright Commission,"I would like to thank Trevor Pearce and Elisabeth Lloyd for helpful feedback, as well as the US-UK Fulbright Commission, which financially supported this work.",,29,0,0,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

There are, however, also situations in which the predictions of the three interlocutors turn out to be theory laden.

It is informed by a richer ideal of empirical success that requires not just accurate prediction but also accurate measurement of parameters by the predicted phenomena. It accepts theory-mediated measurements and theoretical propositions as guides to research. All of these enrichments are exemplified in the classical response to Mercury's perihelion problem. Contrary to Kuhn, Newton's method endorses the radical transition from his theory to Einstein's. The richer themes of Newton's method are strikingly realized in a challenge to general relativity from a new problem posed by Mercury's perihelion.","Univ Western Ontario, Talbot Coll, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Harper, W (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Talbot Coll, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",wlharp@uwo.ca,,,,,,,27,13,16,0,7,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

They accomplish this by manipulating imagistic representations in particular ways. I show that scientists in different domains use the same basic transformations. Common features of these transformations indicate that general cognitive strategies of interpretation, simplification, elaboration, and argumentation are at work. Social and historical studies of science emphasize the diversity of local contexts of practice. However, the existence of common strategies shows that this diversity masks an important repertoire of cognitive strategies. Scientists use this repertoire to adapt their representations to meet the cognitive demands of different contexts of practice. This paper considers the implications of this finding for the notion of scientists as cognitive agents in distributed knowledge-producing systems.","Univ Bath, Dept Psychol, Ctr Sci Studies, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England",University of Bath,"Gooding, DC (corresponding author), Univ Bath, Dept Psychol, Ctr Sci Studies, Bath BA2 7AY, Avon, England.",D.C.Gooding@bath.ac.uk,,,,,,,36,7,9,0,7,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

The main conclusion is that 'social' interests (pursuit of recognition) may conflict with 'cognitive' ones when no constraints are put on the choices of the authors of scientific papers, as in an 'ideal free speech situation'. Scientific institutions may help to solve this conflict.

We present an evolutionary hypothesis that rests on a distinction between three kinds of groups-kin-based groups, small scale coalitions, and ethnies. Following Gil-White (1999,-2001a, 2001b), we propose that ethnies have raised specific evolutionary challenges that were solved by an evolved cognitive system. We suggest that the concept of race is a byproduct of this mechanism.

The Fulling quantization, which is in some sense the natural one for an observer uniformly accelerated through Minkowski spacetime to adopt, is often heralded as a quantization of the Klein-Gordon field which is both physically relevant and unitarily inequivalent to the standard Minkowski quantization. We argue that the Fulling and Minkowski quantizations do not constitute a satisfactory example of physically relevant, unitarily inequivalent quantizations, and indicate what it would take to settle the open question of whether a satisfactory example exists. A popular gloss on the Unruh effect has it that an observer uniformly accelerated through the Minkowski vacuum experiences a thermal flux of Rindler quanta. Taking the Unruh effect, so glossed, to establish that the notion of particle must be relativized to a reference frame, some would use it to demote the particle concept from fundamental status. We explain why technical results do not support the popular gloss and why the attempted demotion of the particle concept is both unsuccessful and unnecessary. Fulling non-uniqueness and the Unruh effect merit attention despite these negative verdicts because they provide excellent vehicles for illustrating key concepts of quantum field theory and for probing foundational issues of considerable philosophical interest.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Philosophy, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; Univ Patras, Dept Philosophy, GR-26500 Patras, Greece",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; University of Patras,"Arageorgis, A (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, 1017 Cathedral Learning, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",arage@upatras.gr; jearman+@pitt.edu; ruetsche@pitt.edu,,,,,,,49,25,26,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Scientists and philosophers of science have traditionally considered the principal aims of science to be explanation and application. Only cognitive values should influence what is taken to be explanatory. Social and political values affect the priority assigned to various scientific problems and the ways in which scientific results are applied. Ethical considerations may be brought to bear on the treatment of human and animal subjects, and the manner in which scientific results are communicated. Recent critiques of science allege that the content of scientific explanations reflects the dominant ideology and interests of scientists and their patrons. Instead of calling for more value neutrality, some now urge that science take as a principal aim the emancipation of oppressed subcultures. Not only should progressive political values be allowed to set the problems attempted, they also should be used to constrain the types of answers which are pursued. Since scientific knowledge is constructed by us, we should take responsibility for its content. This paper argues that the project of Emancipationist science is impractical and self-defeating. There is good reason to believe that there would be unresolvable political disputes concerning which kinds of scientific theories are truly emancipiatory. Furthermore, just as placebos cease to work when recognized as such, so would a science known to be constrained by political considerations lose its special epistemic authority.","Indiana Univ, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Koertge, N (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, 130 Goodbody Hall, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,,,,,,,34,19,22,0,17,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

According to his exegesis of Grunbaum's construction (1984, Ch. 2, Section C; 1993, 184-204) of Freud's ''Tally Argument,'' that argument bespeaks a rife neglect of the epistemologically-significant distinction between empirical evaluations of the efficacy of psychotherapy and evaluations of theoretical explanations of that efficacy. Greenwood presents a defense of a qualified version of Popper's critique of psychoanalysis against Grunbaum's objections to it (1984, Ch. 1B). Finally, Greenwood offers a clarification of the concept of a ''placebo control'' investigation, taking issue with Grunbaum's 1993 (84-87, 91-93). In the present paper, it is argued contra Greenwood that: (1) his purportedly ''best'' reading of Freud's Tally Argument and of its import founders, (2) the distinction that Greenwood bemoans as being neglected by mental health researchers actually is a commonplace in the literature on treatment-process and therapeutic outcome, (3) Greenwood's defense of Popper's critique of psychoanalysis is an anachronism, and (4) Greenwood's conceptual analysis of placebo controls is nebulous and misconceived.",,,"Grunbaum, A (corresponding author), UNIV PITTSBURGH, CTR PHILOSOPHY SCI, 2510 CATHEDRAL LEARNING, PITTSBURGH, PA 15260 USA.",,"Grunbaum, Sergio/HNI-4530-2023","Grunbaum, Sergio/0000-0003-2291-9192",,,,,28,2,2,0,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

It centers on a strengthened Ramsey Test of conditionals: alpha gamma if and only if, after suspending judgment about alpha and gamma, an agent can infer gamma from the supposition of alpha (in the context of further beliefs in the background). Holger Andreas and Mario Gunther used this conditional as the starting point of an analysis of 'because' in natural language.

In both cases, I argue, modelers invite us to imagine or conceive something about the target system, which is known to be either nonexistent (fictional models) or just hypothetical (in perspectival models). I clarify the kind of imagining or conceiving involved in each modeling practice, and I show how each-in its own right-delivers important modal knowledge. I illustrate these two kinds of exploratory models with Maxwell's ether model and supersymmetric particle models at the Large Hadron Collider.","[Massimi, Michela] Univ Edinburgh, Sch Philosophy Psychol & Language Sci, Dugald Stewart Bldg,3 Charles St, Edinburgh EH8 9AD, Midlothian, Scotland",University of Edinburgh,"Massimi, M (corresponding author), Univ Edinburgh, Sch Philosophy Psychol & Language Sci, Dugald Stewart Bldg,3 Charles St, Edinburgh EH8 9AD, Midlothian, Scotland.",michela.massimi@ed.ac.uk,,,European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [H2020-ERC-2014-CoG 647272],European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program,"Earlier versions of this article were presented at the Institute for the History and Philosophy of Science and Technology in Toronto, and at the Models and Simulations 8 conference in South Carolina.

I shall argue that there are two principles directly connected to the two well-known theorems of Emmy Noether concerning global and local symmetries of the free matter-field Lagrangian, in the following referred to as conservation principle and gauge principle. Since both express nothing but certain symmetry features of the free field theory, they are not sufficient to derive a true interaction coupling to a new gauge field. For this purpose it is necessary to advocate a third, truly empirical principle which may be understood as a generalization of the equivalence principle. The second task of the paper is to deal with the ontological question concerning the reality status of gauge potentials in the light of the proposed logical structure of gauge theories. A nonlocal interpretation of topological effects in gauge theories and, thus, the non-reality of gauge potentials in accordance with the generalized equivalence principle will be favored.","Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Philosophie, D-44780 Bochum, Germany",Ruhr University Bochum,"Lyre, H (corresponding author), Ruhr Univ Bochum, Inst Philosophie, Univ Str 150, D-44780 Bochum, Germany.",,,,,,,,13,15,19,0,1,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Deductivism is apparently connected with a demand for clarity and definiteness in the reconstruction of scientists' reasonings. And some philosophers even think that deductivism is the way around the problem of induction. But the deductivist image is challenged by cases of actual scientific reasoning, in which hard-to-state and thus discursively ill-defined elements of thought nonetheless significantly condition what practitioners accept as cogent argument. And arguably, these problem cases abound. For example, even geometry-for most of its history-was such a problem case, despite its exactness and rigor. It took a tremendous effort on the part of Hilbert and others, to make geometry fit the deductivist image. Looking to the empirical sciences, the problems seem worse. Even the most exact and rigorous of empirical sciences-mechanics-is still the kind of problem case which geometry once was. In order for the deductivist image to fit mechanics, Hilbert's sixth problem (for mechanics) would need to be solved. This is a difficult, and perhaps ultimately impossible task, in which the success so far achieved is very limited. I shall explore some consequences of this for realism as well as for deductivism. Through discussing links between non-monotonicity, skills, meaning, globality in cognition, models, scientific understanding, and the ideal of rational unification, I argue that deductivists can defend their image of scientific reasoning only by trivializing it, and that for the adequate illumination of science, insights from anti-deductivism are needed as much as those which come from deductivism.","Univ Canterbury, Canterbury, New Zealand",University of Canterbury,"Catton, P (corresponding author), Private Bag 4800, Christchurch, New Zealand.",p.catton@phil.canterbury.ac.nz,,,,,,,26,1,1,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

However, in the biological context only a contingent set of realizations is actualized.

The nomothetic sciences, such as physics, offer explanations in terms of the laws and regular operations of nature. The ideographic sciences, such as natural history (or, more controversially, evolutionary biology), cast explanations in terms of narratives.

M.",,,The pomp of superfluous causes: The interpretation of evolutionary theory,PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,NATURAL-SELECTION; DRIFT; FITNESS,There are two competing interpretations of the modern synthesis theory of evolution: the dynamical ( also know as 'traditional') and the statistical. The dynamical interpretation maintains that explanations offered under the auspices of the modern synthesis theory articulate the causes of evolution. It interprets selection and drift as causes of population change. The statistical interpretation holds that modern synthesis explanations merely cite the statistical structure of populations. This paper offers a defense of statisticalism. It argues that a change in trait frequencies in a population can be attributed only to selection or drift against the background of a particular statistical description of the population. The traditionalist supposition that selection and drift are description-independent causes of population change leads the dynamical interpretation into a dilemma: it must face a contradiction or accept the loss of explanatory power.,"Univ Toronto, Inst Hist & Philosophy Sci & Technol, Dept Philosophy, Toronto, ON M5S 1K7, Canada",University of Toronto,"Walsh, DM (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Inst Hist & Philosophy Sci & Technol, Dept Philosophy, 91 Charles St W, Toronto, ON M5S 1K7, Canada.",denis.walsh@utoronto.ca,,,,,,,30,75,88,0,6,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

I show that, when reliability assessments enter into inquiries, some stopping rules prescribing optional stopping are unacceptable to both Bayesians and frequentists.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Cathedral Learning 1017, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Backe, A (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Cathedral Learning 1017, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",,,,,,,,13,6,6,0,6,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 SOUTH WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637-1603 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Unlike some critics (Eckhardt 1997), we accept their argument in part: given that we exist, our existence now indeed favors 'Doom sooner' over 'Doom later'. The very fact of our existence, however, favors 'Doom later'. In simple cases, a hypothetical approach to the problem of 'old evidence' shows that these two effects cancel out: our existence now yields no information about the coming of Doom. More complex cases suggest a move from countably additive to non-standard probability measures.","Univ British Columbia, Dept Philosophy, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada; Rice Univ, Houston, TX 77251 USA",University of British Columbia; Rice University,"Bartha, P (corresponding author), Univ British Columbia, Dept Philosophy, 2036 Main Mall, Vancouver, BC V6T 1Z1, Canada.",,,,,,,,8,18,18,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 SOUTH WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637-1603 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

I argue that Ferguson's insistence on explaining actual occurrences and patterns of Yanomami warfare together with his claim that all of his generalizations are statistical raises difficulties for the unification approach, because of its commitment to deductive chauvinism. Moreover, I show that there are serious difficulties involved in comparing the unifying power of Ferguson's explanations to those of his competitors. I show that the causal approach can provide a rich analysis of Ferguson's explanation while avoiding these difficulties.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Steel, D (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, 1017 Cathedral Learning, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",,,,,,,,19,1,1,0,4,PHILOSOPHY SCI ASSN,E LANSING,"MICHIGAN STATE UNIV-DEPT PHIL 18 MORRILL HALL, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

We do not have laws for everything occurring in the world, but only for those situations where what happens in nature is represented by a model: models are blueprints for nomological machines, which in turn give rise to laws.

Here I consider two possible solutions: Quine proposes that we call two theories identical if they are equivalent under a reconstrual of predicates, but this would mishandle important cases. Another proposal is to defer to the particular judgements of actual scientists. Consideration of an historical episode-the alleged equivalence of wave and matrix mechanics-shows that this second proposal also fails.

Much of this debate has been initiated by Michael Friedman and Alan Richardson who argue (against the received view of the Aufbau as a foundationalist defense of empiricism) that Carnap's epistemological project is located in the tradition of neo-Kantian epistemology. On this revisionist reading of the Aufbau, Carnap's project is not motivated to address traditional empiricist problems regarding the justification of knowledge, but rather to show how objective knowledge is possible. A central aspect of the Aufbau that is neglected in the revisionists' analysis is the role of epistemic justification in Carnap's project. The aim of the present study is to argue that although the general epistemology in the Aufbau can be cast as neo-Kantian, Carnap's method of construction theory (or rational reconstruction) is formulated precisely as an empiricist method for the justification of conceptual knowledge. Construction theory radically redefines,empirical justification' into a formal-conventional notion, and is part of Carnap's more general agenda of redefining epistemology as a purely formal discipline.","Univ Chicago, Comm Conceptual & Hist Studies CHSS, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",University of Chicago,"Tsou, JY (corresponding author), Univ Chicago, Comm Conceptual & Hist Studies CHSS, 1126 E 59th St,Room 205, Chicago, IL 60637 USA.",,"Tsou, Jonathan Y./AAE-4891-2020; Tsou, Jonathan/AAE-4891-2020","Tsou, Jonathan Y./0000-0002-3939-1518;",,,,,30,4,5,0,1,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

The definition accommodates information stemming from environmental cues as well as from evolved signals, and calls for a comparison between information-transmission in different types of inheritance systems-the genetic, the epigenetic, the behavioral, and the cultural-symbolic. This comparative perspective highlights the different ways in which information is acquired and transmitted, and the role that such information plays in heredity and evolution. Focusing on the special properties of the transfer of information, which are very different from those associated with the transfer of materials or energy, also helps to uncover interesting evolutionary effects and suggests better explanations for some aspects of the evolution of communication.","Tel Aviv Univ, Cohn Inst Hist & Philosophy Sci & Ideas, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel",Tel Aviv University,"Jablonka, E (corresponding author), Tel Aviv Univ, Cohn Inst Hist & Philosophy Sci & Ideas, IL-69978 Tel Aviv, Israel.",jablonka@post.tau.ac.il,,,,,,,48,133,155,1,25,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

To secure an appropriately epistemic justification for this conclusion, one must explain what it means for a system of partial beliefs to accurately represent the state of the world, and then show that partial beliefs that violate the laws of probability are invariably less accurate than they could be otherwise. The first task can be accomplished once we realize that the accuracy of systems of partial beliefs can be measured on a gradational scale that satisfies a small set of formal constraints, each of which has a sound epistemic motivation. When accuracy is measured in this way it can be shown that any system of degrees of belief that violates the axioms of probability can be replaced by an alternative system that obeys the axioms and yet is more accurate in every possible world. Since epistemically rational agents must strive to hold accurate beliefs, this establishes conformity with the axioms of probability as a norm of epistemic rationality whatever its prudential merits or defects might be.","Univ Michigan, Dept Philosophy, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA",University of Michigan System; University of Michigan,"Joyce, JM (corresponding author), Univ Michigan, Dept Philosophy, 435 S State St, Ann Arbor, MI 48109 USA.",,,,,,,,27,400,451,0,4,PHILOSOPHY SCI ASSN,E LANSING,"MICHIGAN STATE UNIV-DEPT PHIL 18 MORRILL HALL, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

J,"de Regt, HW",,,,"de Regt, Henk W.",,,"Understanding, Values, and the Aims of Science",PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The understanding that comes with scientific explanation is regarded as one of the central epistemic aims of science. In earlier work I have argued that scientists achieve understanding of phenomena by basing their explanations on intelligible theories, where intelligibility is a contextually determined value. In this article, I address the question of how the aim of understanding relates to other epistemic aims of science, such as prediction of empirical evidence and accurate description of phenomena. Moreover, I examine the associated values and analyze their role and interaction through a historical case study.","[de Regt, Henk W.] Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Sci Soc, POB 9010, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands",Radboud University Nijmegen,"de Regt, HW (corresponding author), Radboud Univ Nijmegen, Inst Sci Soc, POB 9010, NL-6500 GL Nijmegen, Netherlands.",henk.deregt@ru.nl,"de+Regt, Henk/AAQ-9218-2021",,Research Foundation Flanders,Research Foundation Flanders(FWO),"I would like to thank my cosymposiasts, Angela Potochnik, Kate Elgin, and Kareem Khalifa, and the audiences at PSA 2018 (Seattle, November 2018) and the inaugural SURe workshop (Bordeaux, February 2019), for helpful discussions.

We can judge that a scientific theory is progressively approximating the truth if it is increasing its explanatory coherence in two key respects: broadening by explaining more phenomena and deepening by investigating layers of mechanisms.

Rather, I examine a question that arises once one has adopted the perspective of distributed cognitive systems, namely, the role of agency in a distributed cognitive system.

While the theorem has been shown to hold for a wide range of many-body models, it is frequently'violated' by results derived from the same models using numerical techniques. This raises the question of how scientists regulate their theoretical commitments in such cases, given that the models, too, are often described as approximations to the underlying 'full' many-body problem.","Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Philosophy, Singapore 117570, Singapore",National University of Singapore,"Gelfert, A (corresponding author), Natl Univ Singapore, Dept Philosophy, 3 Arts Link, Singapore 117570, Singapore.",axel@gelfert.net,"Gelfert, Axel/LKK-9170-2024","Gelfert, Axel/0009-0009-7488-2441",,,,,17,4,5,0,4,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Criteria for empirical testability are presented and used to reexamine two well-known experiments of group selection. I argue that the former holds a narrow image of 'group' that does not distinguish group selection from selection at other levels; while the latter holds a multifaceted image of 'group' that offers a way to achieve substantive progress in the debate. However, most supporters and opponent of group selection maintain a narrow and restricted image of 'group', which implicitly undermines informative details regarding population dynamics and population structure. These details may improve our understanding of the evolution of altruism and the evolution of sociality.

We show that the changes characteristic of scientific revolutions, especially taxonomic changes, can occur in a continuous manner. Using the frame model of concept representation to capture structural relations within concepts and the direct links between concept and taxonomy, we develop an account of conceptual change in science that more adequately reflects the current understanding that episodes like the Copernican revolution are not always abrupt. When concepts are represented by frames, the transformation from one taxonomy to another can be achieved in a piecemeal fashion not preconditioned by a crisis stage, and a new taxonomy can arise naturally out of the old frame instead of emerging separately from the existing conceptual system. This cognitive mechanism of continuous change demonstrates the constructive roles of anomaly and incommensurability in promoting the progress of science.","Calif Lutheran Univ, Dept Philosophy, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 USA; Univ Oklahoma, Dept Hist Sci, Norman, OK 73019 USA",California Lutheran University; University of Oklahoma System; University of Oklahoma - Norman,"Chen, X (corresponding author), Calif Lutheran Univ, Dept Philosophy, 60 W Olsen Rd, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 USA.",,,,,,,,12,18,18,1,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 SOUTH WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637-1603 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

There are two intuitions about causation, both of which face serious counterexamples when used as the basis for an analysis of causation. The 'process' intuition, which says that causes and effects are linked by concrete processes, runs into trouble with cases of misconnections', where an event which serves to prevent another fails to do so on a particular occasion and yet the two events are linked by causal processes. The chance raising intuition, according to which causes raise the chance of their effects, easily accounts for misconnections but faces the problem of chance lowering causes, a problem easily accounted for by the process approach. The integrating program attempts to provide an analysis of singular causation by synthesising the two insights, so as to solve both problems. In this paper I show that extant versions of the integrating program due to Eells, Lewis, and Menzies fail to account for the chance-lowering counterexample. I offer a new diagnosis of the chance lowering case, and use that as a basis for an integrating account of causation which does solve both cases. In doing so, I accept various assumptions of the integrating program, in particular that there are no other problems with these two approaches. As an example of the process account, I focus on the recent CQ theory of Wesley Salmon (1997).","Univ Tasmania, Sch Philosophy, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia",University of Tasmania,"Dowe, P (corresponding author), Univ Tasmania, Sch Philosophy, Box 252-41, Hobart, Tas 7001, Australia.",,,"Dowe, Phil/0000-0001-5437-1139",,,,,29,5,6,0,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 SOUTH WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637-1603 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Since rival DM models differ on their predictions about the structure of DM halos, understanding their mass distribution is crucial for determining the nature of DM. However, only numerical approaches to determining what a hypothesis implies for the mass distribution are possible. Hence, simulations are a crucial part of evaluating DM rival models, as is assessing their reliability. I argue that robustness analysis is not a sufficient criterion for the trustworthiness of cosmological simulations.","[Gueguen, Marie] Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Philosophy Sci, 1117 Cathedral Learning,4200 Fifth Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Gueguen, M (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Ctr Philosophy Sci, 1117 Cathedral Learning,4200 Fifth Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",mgueguen@uwo.ca,,,John Templeton Foundation [61048],John Templeton Foundation,"I am very grateful to Chris Smeenk for his support and advice.

I focus on a series of experiments where optogenetics is used to study false memory and forgetting.","[Robins, Sarah K.] Univ Kansas, Philosophy Dept, 3090 Wescoe Hall,1445 Jayhawk Blvd, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA",University of Kansas,"Robins, SK (corresponding author), Univ Kansas, Philosophy Dept, 3090 Wescoe Hall,1445 Jayhawk Blvd, Lawrence, KS 66045 USA.",skrobins@ku.edu,"; Robins, Sarah/OGP-0197-2025","Robins, Sarah/0000-0003-2439-4633;",,,,,22,20,21,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Analysis of his manuscripts from this period reveals that Newton's understanding of the relativity of acceleration led him to seek a spatiotemporally invariant quantity of matter. He found two such quantities and then designed an experiment to discover their relationship. Interpreting the experiment, however, required distinguishing a new notion of force. Others have recognized the conceptual distinction between inertial and gravitational mass. I show here that Newton clearly saw this distinction and that he provisionally established their equivalence.","[Fox, Craig W.] Univ Western Ontario, Dept Philosophy, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5B8, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Fox, CW (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Philosophy, 1151 Richmond St, London, ON N6A 5B8, Canada.",craigwilliamfox@gmail.com,,,Rotman Institute of Philosophy,Rotman Institute of Philosophy,"I am deeply indebted to George Smith for countless discussions related to this project and for his support and encouragement.

Gould argues for a hierarchical conception of the living world and of the evolutionary processes that have built that living world: organisms are built from smaller components (genes, cells) and are themselves components of groups, populations, species, lineages. Selection, drift and constraint are important to all of these levels of biological organization, not just that of individual organisms. Moreover, both drift and constraint are more important than orthodoxy supposes. While having some sympathy for both of these lines of argument, I argue that they are more problematic than Gould supposes, and that he understates the power and the heterogeneity of orthodox conceptions of life's evolution.","Victoria Univ Wellington, Philosophy Program, Wellington, New Zealand; Australian Natl Univ, RSSS, Philosophy Program, Canberra, ACT 0200, Australia",Victoria University Wellington; Australian National University,"Sterelny, K (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Philosophy Program, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",,,"Sterelny, Kim/0000-0003-3159-6698",,,,,1,8,11,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

The evolutionary game with signals is found to have dramatically different dynamics from the same game without signals. Signals change stability properties of equilibria in the base game, create new polymorphic equilibria, and change the basins of attraction of equilibria in the base game. Signals carry information at equilibrium in the case of the new polymorphic equilibria, but transient information is the basis for large changes in the magnitude of basins of attraction of equilibria in the base game.

In the classical model the logic of backward induction is valid, but it does not use subjunctive conditionals; the relevant subjunctive conditionals do not even make sense.

This may have been Helmholtz's view, and it, too, has attractive features. It reveals the close connection between measurement and natural law, it makes dimensional analysis intelligible, and explains the concern of scientists and engineers with units in equations. It leaves the philosophical problem of the relation between the structure of magnitudes and the structure of the reals. What explains it? And is it always the same? We will argue that on the whole, construing the values of quantities as magnitudes has some advantages, and that (as Helmholtz seems to suggest in Numbering and Measuring from an Epistemological Viewpoint) the relation between magnitudes and real numbers can be based on foundational similarities of structure.","Univ Rochester, Dept Philosophy, Rochester, NY 14627 USA; Univ Rochester, Dept Comp Sci, Rochester, NY 14627 USA",University of Rochester; University of Rochester,"Kyburg, HE (corresponding author), Univ Rochester, Dept Philosophy, 601 Elmwood Ave, Rochester, NY 14627 USA.",kyburg@cs.rochester.edu,,,,,,,26,20,20,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Unfortunately, the search for its resolution is hampered by open disagreement about what is, strictly, the problem. This disagreement stems from the observation that the CCP is not a problem within any of our current theories, and nearly all of the details of those future theories for which the CCP could be made a problem are up for grabs. Given this state of affairs, I discuss how one ought to make sense of the role of the CCP in physics and generalize some lessons from it.","[Schneider, Mike D.] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Log & Philosophy Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Schneider, MD (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Log & Philosophy Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",mdschnei@uci.edu,,"Schneider, Mike D./0000-0002-3303-3664","John Templeton Foundation [59773, 61048]",John Templeton Foundation,"I would like to thank James Owen Weatherall and Erik Curiel for their steering comments on earlier drafts of this article.

With only minor modifications he stuck to this account throughout his life. The aim of this paper is to disprove Carnap's contention by invoking some classical theorems of differential topology. It is shown that his metrical conventionalism is indefensible for mathematical reasons.

J,"Potochnik, A",,,,"Potochnik, Angela",,,Idealization and Many Aims,PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"In this article, I first outline the view developed in my recent book on the role of idealization in scientific understanding.

Such a view has been advocated by scientists and philosophers alike. Important details, however, have yet to be spelled out.

How does assessing a model's adequacy-for-purpose differ from assessing its representational accuracy? In addition, responses are given to some objections that might be raised against an adequacy-for-purpose view.","[Parker, Wendy S.] Univ Durham, Dept Philosophy, 50 Old Elvet, Durham DH1 3HN, England",Durham University,"Parker, WS (corresponding author), Univ Durham, Dept Philosophy, 50 Old Elvet, Durham DH1 3HN, England.",wendy.parker@durham.ac.uk,,"Parker, Wendy/0000-0001-7796-3401",European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [667526 K4U],European Research Council (ERC) under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program(European Research Council (ERC)),"For helpful comments and suggestions, the author wishes to thank Donal Khosrowi, Leonard Smith, Adrian Currie, Eric Winsberg, Durham's CHESS research group, and several anonymous referees.

Lloyd has challenged my claim that a plurality of models correctly accounts for situations such as maintenance of the sickle-cell trait, and I revisit this example to show that competing theories don't disagree about the existence of 'high-level' or 'low-level' causes; rather, they parse these causes differently. Applying Woodward's theory of causation, I analyze Sober's distinction between 'selection of' versus 'selection for'. My analysis shows that this distinction separates true causes from pseudocauses, but it also reveals that the distinction is irrelevant to the levels debate; it makes no sense to say true causes are at higher levels and not lower levels. The levels debate is not about separating real causes from pseudocauses; it's about finding useful ways to parse and disentangle causes.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Philosophy, Minnesota Ctr Philosophy Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55408 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Waters, CK (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Philosophy, Minnesota Ctr Philosophy Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55408 USA.",ckwaters@umn.edu,,,,,,,29,24,28,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

However, unless the expected utility framework is simply assumed, such preferences are also consistent with being representable as having degrees of belief that do not obey the laws of probability. This fact shows that being representable as having subjective probabilities is not necessarily the same as having subjective probabilities. Probabilism can be defended on the basis of the representation theorems only if attributions of degrees of belief are understood either antirealistically or purely qualitatively, or if the representation theorems are supplemented by arguments based on other considerations (simplicity, consilience, and so on) that single out the representation of a person as having subjective probabilities as the only true representation of the mental state of any person whose preferences conform to the axioms of expected utility theory.","Indiana Univ, Dept Philosophy, South Bend, IN 46634 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University South Bend,"Zynda, L (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Philosophy, 1700 Mishawaka Ave,POB 7111, South Bend, IN 46634 USA.",,,,,,,,33,38,41,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 SOUTH WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637-1603 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Even though certain cases in which evidence used for the construction of the hypothesis can test the hypothesis severely, I do not think that her severity criterion fits better with our intuition about good tests than use-novelty. I argue for this by showing a parallelism in terms of severity between the confidence interval case and what she calls 'gellerization'.

Despite the theoretically important role the concept of individuality plays in modern phylogenetic systematics and in evolutionary theory more generally, many have been content to rely on common-sense intuitions about what counts as an individual. One of the most often cited intuitions is that individuals should be defined intrinsically. Unfortunately, common-sense intuitions like this one have proven to be inadequate for identifying and characterizing historical individuals (like species).

Then we show that quantum uncertainty, at the level of DNA mutations, can ''percolate'' up to have major populational effects. Interesting as this point may be it does not show any autonomous indeterminism of the evolutionary process. In the next two sections we investigate drift and natural selection as the locus of autonomous biological indeterminacy. Here we conclude that the population-level indeterminacy of natural selection and drift are ultimately based on the assumption of a fundamental indeterminacy at the Level of the lives and deaths of individual organisms. The following section examines this assumption and defends it from the determinists' attack. Then we show that, even if one rejects the assumption, there is still an important reason why one might think evolutionary theory (ET) is autonomously indeterministic. In the concluding section we contrast the arguments we have mounted against a deterministic hidden variable account of ET with the proof of the impossibility of such an account of QM.","DUKE UNIV,DEPT ZOOL,DURHAM,NC 27708",Duke University,"Brandon, RN (corresponding author), DUKE UNIV,DEPT PHILOSOPHY,DURHAM,NC 27708, USA.",,,,,,,,31,61,71,0,5,PHILOSOPHY SCI ASSN,E LANSING,"MICHIGAN STATE UNIV-DEPT PHIL 18 MORRILL HALL, E LANSING, MI 48824",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

It is argued that the subdynamics approach involves a generalized form of 'coarse-graining' description, whereas, transformation theory cannot lead to truly irreversible processes pointing to a preferred direction of time. It is concluded that the Brussels school's conception of microscopic temporal irreversibility, as such, is tacitly assumed at the macroscopic level.

Meir Hemmo and Orly R. Shenker recently challenged this argument by pointing out an alleged discrepancy between the two entropies in the single-particle case, concluding that they must be distinct. In this article, their argument is shown to be problematic as it (a) allows for a violation of the second law of thermodynamics and (b) is based on an incorrect calculation of the von Neumann entropy.","[Prunkl, Carina E.

Focusing on the versions of the unificationist theory of explanation of Kitcher and of Schurz and Lambert, I establish three theses. First, Kitcher's criterion of unification is vitiated by the fact that it entails that every proposition can be explained by itself, a flaw that it is unable to overcome. Second, because neither Kitcher's theory nor that of Schurz and Lambert can solve the problems of asymmetry and accidental generalizations, it follows that unification is not sufficient to ground explanation. Third, some good explanations are disunifying, which entails that unification is not necessary for explanation either.","Leiden Univ, Fac Philosophy, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands",Leiden University - Excl LUMC; Leiden University,"Gijsbers, V (corresponding author), Leiden Univ, Fac Philosophy, Postbus 9515, NL-2300 RA Leiden, Netherlands.",V.Gijsbers@let.leidenuniv.nl,,,,,,,14,23,28,0,4,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Weyl showed that group theory is the underlying mathematical structure for symmetry in all three domains. But in this study Weyl did not include appeals to symmetry arguments which, for example, Einstein expressed as for reasons of symmetry (wegen der Symmetrie; aus Symmetriegrunden). An argument typically takes the form of a set of premises and rules of inference that lead to a conclusion. Symmetry may enter an argument both in the premises and the rules of inference, and the resulting conclusion may also exhibit symmetrical properties.

The alleged disproof appeals to the possibility of suitable background theories to show that no theory choice can be timelessly or noncontextually underdetermined: Foreground theories might be distinguished against different backgrounds. Philosophers have often replied to such a disproof by focussing their attention not on theories but on Total Sciences.

While it may be possible to defend a realist position regarding biological relations among organisms, biological populations are made when contextual features determine which kinds and degrees of relations to privilege over others, and so how to bound genes in space and time.

After a brief account of the recent claims the paper reviews the development of the orbit and later orbital concepts and analyzes the theoretical status of atomic orbitals. The conclusion is that contrary to these claims, atomic orbitals have not in fact been observed. The non-referring nature of modem atomic orbitals is discussed in the context of Laudan's writings on realism, the success of theories, and whether or not scientific terms refer. I conclude that the failure to observe orbitals is a good prima facie case for divorcing the success of theories from the question of whether their central terms refer. The added relevance of this case is that it concerns a current and highly successful theory. Finally, the relevance of this 'floating model' to contemporary discussions on scientific models is briefly considered.","Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA",University of California System; University of California Los Angeles,"Scerri, ER (corresponding author), Univ Calif Los Angeles, Dept Chem & Biochem, 405 Hilgard Ave, Los Angeles, CA 90095 USA.",scerri@chem.ucla.edu,"Scerri, Eric/B-8672-2014",,,,,,12,26,28,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Dismayed, I take a closer look at it. I find that the question it poses-very roughly, whether scientific knowledge is true (approximately true, put forward as true, etc.) or only useful (empirically adequate, a convenient method of representation, etc.)- -actually suppresses socially critical thought and discussion about science (e.g., concerning whether scientific knowledge is sexist or racist or socially harmful in other ways, or whether scientific knowledge is useful for achieving the goals we have or the goals we ought to have). I find, as well, that two of the most important responses to the realism/antirealism controversy-that which construes it as concerned with science's aims and that which construes it as concerned with science's results-fail to make sufficient empirical or normative contact with science. As a consequence, they provide representations of science that either do not help scientists (or nonscientists) make informed decisions about science, or actually hinder these individuals from doing so. I conclude that we should either stop engaging in the realism/ antirealism controversy entirely, or else engage in it in a more socially responsible way-by gathering the right kinds of empirical and normative data, and framing more helpful versions of the questions we want to ask.

We have done this to show, for instance, that factors that have similar sorts of impact on a developing organism tend nevertheless to be invested with quite different causal importance. We have made similar arguments about evolutionary processes. Together, these analyses have allowed DST not only to cut through some age-old muddles about the nature of development, but also to effect a long-delayed reintegration of development into evolutionary theory. Our penchant for causal symmetry, however (or 'causal democracy', as it has recently been termed), has sometimes been misunderstood. This paper shows that causal symmetry is neither a platitude about multiple influences nor a denial of useful distinctions, but a powerful way of exposing hidden assumptions and opening up traditional formulations to fruitful change.","CUNY John Jay Coll Criminal Justice, New York, NY 10019 USA; CUNY, Grad Ctr, New York, NY USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System; John Jay College of Criminal Justice (CUNY); City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Oyama, S (corresponding author), 924 W End Ave,44, New York, NY 10025 USA.",,,,,,,,30,46,53,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

I focus on two specific aspects of Gopnik and Meltzoff's approach: the relation between their views and recapitulationist views of ontogeny and phylogeny in biology, and their overall conception of cognition as a set of veridical processes. First, I discuss several issues that arise from their appeal to evolutionary biology, focusing specifically on the role of distinctions between ontogeny and phylogeny when appealing to biology for theoretical support. Second, I argue that to presuppose that cognition is veridical or truth-tropic can compromise attempts to understand scientific cognition both throughout history and in the present. Finally, I briefly sketch an evolutionary approach to understanding scientific development that contrasts with Gopnik and Meltzoff's.","Univ Utah, Dept Philosophy, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Downes, SM (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Philosophy, 260 Cent Campus Dr,Rm 341, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",,,"Downes, Stephen M./0000-0001-9363-3322",,,,,24,3,4,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Further, frequently the point of a statistical explanation is to identify the etiology of its explanandum, but on standard models probabilistic explanations often fail to do so. This paper offers an alternative conception of statistical explanations on which explanations of the frequency of a property consist in the derivation of that frequency from a statistical specification of the mechanism by which instances of the relevant property are produced.

Specifically, I demonstrate that reductionists must subscribe to the unargued and problematic thesis that molecular genetics is 'independent' of classical genetics. I also argue that several standard antireductionist positions can be faulted for unnecessarily conceding the Independence Thesis to the reductionists. In place of a 'tale of two sciences', I offer a 'heroic' stance that denies classical genetics is being reduced, yet sees classical and molecular genetics as fundamentally unified.",,,"Vance, RE (corresponding author), UNIV CALIF BERKELEY, DEPT MOL & CELL BIOL, 485 LIFE SCI ADDIT, BERKELEY, CA 94720 USA.",,,,,,,,13,18,20,0,4,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Instead, I propose an analysis of transparency as having three forms: transparency of the algorithm, the realization of the algorithm in code, and the way that code is run on particular hardware and data. This targets the transparency most useful for a task, avoiding instrumentalism by providing partial transparency when full transparency is impossible.","[Creel, Kathleen A.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, 1101 Cathedral Learning,4200 Fifth Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Creel, KA (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, 1101 Cathedral Learning,4200 Fifth Ave, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",,,"Creel, Kathleen/0000-0001-7371-2680",,,,,45,79,104,2,21,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

In particular I will criticize two key distinctions Ellis draws between internal vs. external properties and essential vs. accidental properties, showing that at the chemical level such distinctions are insupportable. If essential properties only exist at the level of sub-atomic physics, then Ellis's hopes that essentialism will provide a theoretical basis for a philosophy of chemistry are at best hopes for a very distant future, since the argument that chemical structure and dynamics can be explained at the quantum level derived is purely from analogy to much simpler systems than those chemists actually study.

Chemists routinely use important terms ('' element,'' '' atom,'' '' molecule,'' '' substance '') with more than one meaning. This can lead to misunderstandings. Eliminativists claim that what seems to be a baseball breaking a window is merely the action of '' atoms, acting in concert.'' They argue that statues, baseballs, and similar macroscopic things '' do not exist.'' When macroscopic objects like baseballs move, exceedingly large numbers (similar to 10(25)) of microscopic components coordinate their activities. Understanding how this happens requires attention to the interactions that link parts into larger units. Eliminativists say that everything that truly exists has causal relationships in addition to those of its components - '' nonredundant causality.'' This paper holds that if a number of entities interact in such a way that the effect of that collection on test objects is different than it would have been in the absence of the interaction, then identification of that collection as a single composite agent is warranted, for purposes to which that difference is relevant. Ordinary '' chemical substances '' (both elementary materials such as dihydrogen and compounds such as water) fulfill this version of the requirement of nonredundant causality. Other sorts of chemical coherences, including chemical dissipative structures (e. g., flames), also fulfill that criterion. All these types of coherences qualify as '' substances '' (as that term is used in philosophy) even though they are not all '' chemical substances.''.","Georgetown Univ, Dept Chem, Falls Church, VA 22046 USA",Georgetown University,"Earley, JE (corresponding author), Georgetown Univ, Dept Chem, 502 W Broad St,Suite 501, Falls Church, VA 22046 USA.",earleyj@georgetown.edu,"Earley, Joseph/AAG-3329-2020",,,,,,29,10,10,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

David Lewis has shown that the NP may be modelled as a Prisoner's Dilemma game (PD) in which 'cooperating' corresponds to 'taking one box'. Adopting relevant results from game theory, this means that one should take just one box if the NP is repeated an indefinite number of times, but both boxes if it is a one-shot game. Causal decision theorists thus give the right answer for the one-shot situation, whereas the one-boxers' solution applies to the indefinitely iterated case. Because Nozick's set-up of the NP is ambiguous between a one-shot and a repeated game, both of these solutions may appear plausible--depending on whether one conceives of the situation as one-off or repeated. If the players' aim is to maximize their payoffs, the symmetric structure of the PD implies that the two players will behave alike both when the game is one-shot and when it is played repeatedly. Therefore neither the observed outcome of both players selecting the same strategy (in the PD) nor, correspondingly, the predictor's accurate prediction of this outcome (in the NP) is at all surprising. There is no need for a supernatural predictor to explain the NP phenomena.","Univ Witten Herdecke, Fac Econ & Management, D-58448 Witten, Germany",Witten Herdecke University,"Schmidt-Petri, C (corresponding author), Univ Witten Herdecke, Fac Econ & Management, Alfred Herrhausen Str 50, D-58448 Witten, Germany.",christoph.schmidt-petri@uni-wh.de,,,,,,,34,1,1,0,11,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

This paper argues that while such clarification is necessary, it is not a sufficient condition for achieving better science and policy; indeed its importance may be overemphasized. Using a case study involving the current, highly politicized controversy over the shape of dose-response curves for biological effects of ionizing radiation, the paper argues that the conflict could be significantly resolved through specific methodological improvements in the areas of metascience and philosophy of science. These improvements focus on taking account, respectively, of scale, data trimming, aggregation, measurability, and simplicity.","Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; Univ Notre Dame, Dept Philosophy, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame,"Shrader-Frechette, K (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, 100 Malloy Dr, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",kshrader@nd.edu,,,,,,,25,9,10,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

I outline an alternative, according to which natural selection explains adaptive evolution by appeal to the statistical structure of populations, and development explains the causes of adaptive evolution at the level of individuals.

It is argued that 'geometric proofs' of absolute space, first proposed by Kant (1768), fail, but that parity violating laws allow 'mechanical proofs', like Newton's laws. Parity violating laws are explained and arguments analogous to those of Newton's Scholium are constructed to show that they require absolute spacetime structure-namely, an orientation-as Newtonian mechanics requires affine structure. Finally, it is considered how standard relationist responses to Newton's argument might respond to the new challenge of parity nonconservation.","Univ Illinois, Dept Philosophy, Chicago, IL 60607 USA",University of Illinois System; University of Illinois Chicago; University of Illinois Chicago Hospital,"Huggett, N (corresponding author), Univ Illinois, Dept Philosophy, MC 267,1421 Univ Hall,601 Morgan St, Chicago, IL 60607 USA.",,,,,,,,28,10,12,0,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 SOUTH WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637-1603 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

In QFT, the classical notion of a particle collapses. The theory does not only exclude classical, i.e., spatiotemporally identifiable particles, but it makes particles of the same type conceptually indistinguishable. Teller and Auyang have proposed competing ersatz-ontologies to account for the 'loss of particles': field quanta vs. field events. Both ontologies, however, suffer from serious defects. While quanta lack numerical identity, spatiotemporal localizability, and independence of basis-representations, events-if understood as concrete measurement events-are related to the theory only statistically. I propose an alternative solution: The entities of QFT are events of the type 'Quantum system, S, is in quantum state, Psi'. These are not point events, but Davidsonian events, i.e., they can be identified by their location within the causal net of the world.","Univ Gesamthsch Paderborn, Fachbereich Philosophie 1, D-33095 Paderborn, Germany",University of Paderborn,"Bartels, A (corresponding author), Univ Gesamthsch Paderborn, Fachbereich Philosophie 1, Warburger Str 100, D-33095 Paderborn, Germany.",,,,,,,,17,4,5,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

When these communities disagree about a scholarly achievement's credit assignment, this raises a puzzle for decision and game theoretic models of credit seeking in science. The reference class problem for credit valuation in science is the problem of determining to which of an agent's communities-which reference class-credit determinations should be indexed for an act under some state of nature. Solving this problem requires developing rich, mutually informed theories of community and credit that are sensitive to the structure and status systems of complex, heterogeneous scholarly networks.","[Lee, Carole J.] Univ Washington, Dept Philosophy, Box 353350, Seattle, WA 98195 USA",University of Washington; University of Washington Seattle,"Lee, CJ (corresponding author), Univ Washington, Dept Philosophy, Box 353350, Seattle, WA 98195 USA.",c3@uw.edu,,"Lee, Carole/0000-0002-5323-9205","National Science Foundation [1759825]; Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities [1759825] Funding Source: National Science Foundation","National Science Foundation(National Science Foundation (NSF)); Direct For Social, Behav & Economic Scie; SBE Off Of Multidisciplinary Activities(National Science Foundation (NSF)NSF - Directorate for Social, Behavioral & Economic Sciences (SBE))","Many thanks to Christopher Adolph, Melinda Baldwin, Alex Csiszar, Aileen Fyfe, Sheridan Grant, Crystal Hall, Remco Heesen, Liam Kofi-Bright, Jessica Lundquist, Joseph Martin, Conor Mayo-Wilson, Ties Nijssen, Cailin O'Connor, and Kevin Zollman for illuminating conversations.

Given the partiality and perspectivism of representation, pluralism preserving integration can increase accuracy. Perspectivism is often supported by appeal to visual representation. I draw further insights from multimodel sensory integration for understanding experiment-based predictions of protein structure. The epistemic lessons learned from the scientific case also apply to philosophy of science itself. Finally, I suggest that a critical, nuanced philosophical view of legitimate sources of pluralism in science has an important role to play in public discourse.","[Mitchell, Sandra D.] Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, 1101 Cathedral Learning, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Mitchell, SD (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, 1101 Cathedral Learning, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",smitchel@pitt.edu,"Mitchell, Sandra/KUX-7918-2024",,,,,,49,12,14,0,5,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

As examples, judgments involving criteria such as simplicity and symmetry are often cited. However, other theory selection criteria, such as fecundity, coherence, internal consistency, and fertility, more closely match those criteria used in art contexts and by scholars working in aesthetics. Paying closer attention to the way these criteria are used in art contexts allows us to understand some evaluative and developmental practices in scientific theory selection as genuinely aesthetic, enlarging the scope of the goals of science.","[O'Loughlin, Ian] Pacific Univ, 2043 Coll Way, Forest Grove, OR 97116 USA; [McCallum, Kate] Univ Brighton, Mithras House,Lewes Rd, Brighton BN2 4AT, E Sussex, England",Pacific University; University of Brighton,"O'Loughlin, I (corresponding author), Pacific Univ, 2043 Coll Way, Forest Grove, OR 97116 USA.",ian.oloughlin@pacificu.edu; k.mccallum@brighton.ac.uk,,,,,,,50,8,8,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

This paper addresses Orzack and Sober's criticisms by giving a new account of robustness analysis and showing how the practice can identify robust theorems. Once the structure of robust theorems is clearly articulated, it can be shown that such theorems have a degree of confirmation, despite the lack of direct empirical evidence for their truth.","Univ Penn, Dept Philosophy, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Weisberg, M (corresponding author), Univ Penn, Dept Philosophy, 433 Logan Hall, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",weisberg@phil.upenn.edu,,,,,,,11,183,211,1,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Even if monism is determined to be untenable in certain domains (say, about species), it might well be tenable in others. Chemistry is suggested to be such a monist-friendly domain. Suggestions of trouble for chemical kinds can be defused by attending to the difference between monism as a metaphysical thesis and as a claim about classification systems. Finally, I consider enantiomers as a test case for the monism/pluralism debate. The question of whether enantiomers differ in kind does not appear easily answerable.

The model conceives of inquiry as a game between Nature and a scientist. To begin the game, a nonlogical vocabulary is agreed upon by the two players, along with a partition of a class of countable structures for that vocabulary. Next, Nature secretly chooses one structure (the real world) from some cell of the partition. She then presents the scientist with a sequence of facts about the chosen structure. With each new datum the scientist announces a guess about the cell to which the chosen structure belongs. To succeed in his or her inquiry, the scientist's successive conjectures must be correct all but finitely often, that is, the conjectures must converge in the limit to the correct cell. Different kinds of scientists can be investigated within this framework. At opposite ends of the spectrum are dumb scientists that rely on the strategy of induction by enumeration, and smart scientists that rely on an operator of belief revision. We report some results about the scope and limits of these two inductive strategies.","Univ New S Wales, Sch Engn & Comp Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia; Rice Univ, Dept Psychol, Houston, TX 77005 USA",University of New South Wales Sydney; Rice University,"Martin, E (corresponding author), Univ New S Wales, Sch Engn & Comp Sci, Sydney, NSW 2052, Australia.",,,,,,,,12,1,1,0,4,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

In this paper, I shall summarize the debate, sketching the problems that remain within the two opposing positions, and show that both have ended on their own slippery slope, sliding away from their original position toward that of their opponents. In the search for a viable intermediate position, I shall then suggest an account of reference which, to a degree, follows the causal theory in explaining reference as carving the world at its joints. Contrary to the causal theory, however, I submit that this world is a phenomenal world whose variable joints exist only in a historical process in which they are transmitted gradually from one generation to the next. According to this account, the joints of the phenomenal world are constituted by family resemblance, where bundles of features that span bounded areas in perceptual space underlie the joints. Furthermore, the integrity of the cognitive process by which these joints are recognized depends on a transmission process by which new generations are presented with given joints and bundles by the preceding generation. Contrary to a traditional realist account, this heritage from the preceding generation may be transformed into new joints and bundles before transmission to new generations. This permits a continuous process of referential change in which the joints and bundles at different stages in the development of a theory can be connected by chains-of-reasoning.","Univ Copenhagen, Panum Inst, Dept Med Philosophy & Clin Theory, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Andersen, H (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Panum Inst, Dept Med Philosophy & Clin Theory, Bldg 22-3,Blegdamsvej 3, DK-2200 Copenhagen N, Denmark.",,"Andersen, Hanne/A-4364-2016","Andersen, Hanne/0000-0003-2050-4540",,,,,20,9,11,0,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

This motivates an inquiry into the physical status of various concepts of localization. It is argued that a covariant generalization of Newton-Wigner localization is a physically illuminating concept. When analyzed in terms of nonlocally covariant quantum fields, creating and annihilating quanta in Newton-Wigner localized states, the vacuum is seen to not possess the spacelike superentanglement that the Reeh-Schlieder theorem displays relative to local fields, and to be locally empty as well as globally empty. Newton-Wigner localization is then shown to be physically interpretable in terms of a covariant generalization of the center of energy, the two localizations being identical if the system has no internal angular momentum. Finally, some of the counterintuitive features of Newton-Wigner localization are shown to have dose analogues in classical special relativity.","Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, Davey Lab 325, University Pk, PA 16802 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); Pennsylvania State University; Pennsylvania State University - University Park,"Fleming, GN (corresponding author), Penn State Univ, Dept Phys, Davey Lab 325, University Pk, PA 16802 USA.",gnf1@earthlink.nct,,,,,,,22,22,25,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

In a concluding section, using an ''improper'' prior, we illustrate how the preceding results depend upon the assumption that probability is countably additive.",,,"Kadane, JB (corresponding author), CARNEGIE MELLON UNIV, DEPT PHILOSOPHY, SCHENLEY PK, PITTSBURGH, PA 15213 USA.",,,,,,,,15,5,5,0,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Many assume that OI is sufficient for a robustness argument to be warranted. However, we argue that, as typically construed, OI is not a sufficient independence condition for warranting robustness arguments. We show that OI evidence can collectively confirm a hypothesis to a lower degree than individual lines of evidence, contrary to the standard assumption undergirding usual robustness arguments.

Specifically, analysis of contemporary research on chemical hormesis (i.e., alleged beneficial biological effects produced by low doses of substances that are harmful at higher doses) suggests that scientists may initially describe anomalous phenomena in terms of multiple distinct '' characterizations,'' each of which is compatible with current empirical evidence. By focusing attention on this feature of scientific anomalies, philosophers of science can alleviate the controversy over low-dose chemical effects in at least two ways: (1) they can pinpoint the significant ways in which particular characterizations frame the controversy, and (2) they can identify the methodological value judgments at stake in researchers' choice of characterizations.","Univ S Carolina, Dept Philosophy, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Elliott, KC (corresponding author), Univ S Carolina, Dept Philosophy, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",ke@sc.edu,,,,,,,38,5,5,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

But the central ideas on which these theories are built need not be combined and opposed to one another in precisely the ways envisaged by these ancient theories. This is well illustrated by Duhem, who maintained the Aristotelian idea that the original ingredients are only potentially, and not actually, present in a mixture, but who sided with the Stoics and against Aristotle on the possibility of co-occupancy. I have argued that the Stoic theory cannot dispense with some such notion as the Aristotelian conception of potentiality in allowing the elements to be actually present in a mixture. Here I suggest that some such Aristotelian notion must be at work in a more modern atomic conception of matter if this is to allow elemental substances to be actually present in compounds, which I think is how compounds are usually understood.

Consequently, an evolutionary psychology-which regards psychological mechanisms as adaptations-should replace sociobiology. I address two interpretations of their argument. I argue that the strong interpretation fails because functionalist psychology need not prevent behaviors from evolving independently, and it relies on too strong an interpretation of the quasi-independence criterion. The weaker interpretation does not undermine sociobiology, and evolutionary psychology would be vulnerable to the same criticism.

According to David Malament (1982), Field's strategy cannot be extended to quantum mechanics (QM), and so it only has a limited scope. In a recent work, Mark Balaguer has responded to Malament's challenge by indicating how QM can be nominalized, and by doing much of the work needed to provide the nominalization (Balaguer 1998, 114). In this paper, I critically assess Balaguer's proposal, and argue that it ultimately fails. Balaguer's strategy is incompatible with a number of interpretations of QM, in particular with Bas van Fraassen's version of the modal interpretation. And given that Balaguer's strategy invokes physically real propensities, it is unclear whether it is even compatible with nominalism. I conclude that the nominalization of QM remains a major problem for the nominalist.","Univ S Carolina, Dept Philosophy, Columbia, SC 29208 USA",University of South Carolina System; University of South Carolina Columbia,"Bueno, O (corresponding author), Univ S Carolina, Dept Philosophy, Columbia, SC 29208 USA.",obueno@sc.edu,,,,,,,11,8,11,0,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

In that. case, inconsistency proofs such as that of Sharp and Shanks (1993) are not applicable, and the main issue becomes not whether such statements are true, but whether they are nontrivial. The latter question is addressed and answered in the negative. Thus it is concluded that TSQCs, understood as counterfactuals with a compound antecedent, are true but only trivially so, and provide no new contingent information about specific quantum systems (except in special cases already identified in literature).","Univ Maryland, Dept Philosophy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA",University System of Maryland; University of Maryland College Park,"Kastner, RE (corresponding author), Univ Maryland, Dept Philosophy, College Pk, MD 20742 USA.",,,,,,,,31,10,10,0,4,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Although experiment plays many roles in science, its classical role is testing hypotheses in controlled laboratory settings. Historical science (which includes work in geology, biology, and astronomy, as well as paleontology and archaeology) is sometimes held to be inferior on the grounds that its hypothesis cannot be tested by controlled laboratory experiments. Using contemporary examples from diverse scientific disciplines, this paper explores differences in practice between historical and experimental research vis-A-vis the testing of hypotheses. It rejects the claim that historical research is epistemically inferior. For as I argue, scientists engage in two very different patterns of evidential reasoning and, although there is overlap, one pattern predominates in historical research and the other pattern predominates in classical experimental research. I show that these different patterns of reasoning are grounded in an objective and remarkably pervasive time asymmetry of nature.","Univ Colorado, Dept Philosophy, Boulder, CO 80309 USA; Univ Colorado, Ctr Astrobiol, Boulder, CO 80309 USA",University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder; University of Colorado System; University of Colorado Boulder,"Cleland, CE (corresponding author), Univ Colorado, Dept Philosophy, Campus Box 232,169 Hellems, Boulder, CO 80309 USA.",cleland@spot.colorado.edu,,,,,,,40,234,285,0,31,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

At one point it appeared that Malament (1977) had settled the issue by proving that the only non-trivial equivalence relation definable from (temporally symmetric) causal connectability is the standard simultaneity relation. Recently, however, Sarkar and Stachel (1999) claim to have identified a suspect assumption in the proof by defining a non-standard simultaneity relation from causal connectability. I contend that their critique is based on a misunderstanding of the criteria for the definability of a relation, a misunderstanding that Malement's original treatment helped to foster. There are in fact a variety of notions of definability that can be brought to bear. They all, however, require a condition that suffices to secure Malament's result. The non-standard relation Sarkar and Stachel claim to be definable is not so definable, and, I argue, their proposal to modify the notion of causal definability is misguided.

Jeffrey's approach has also been criticized on the grounds that it makes it impossible to extract a unique probability/ utility representation from a sufficiently rich system of preferences (given a zero and unit for measuring utility). The existence of these problems should not blind us to the fact that Jeffrey's system has advantages that no other decision theory can match: it can be underwritten by a particularly compelling representation theorem proved by Ethan Bolker; and it has a property called partition invariance that every reasonable theory of rational choice must possess.

Here I shall indicate one aspect of Feyerabend's divided legacy. My main aims are to sketch the principal themes in his (fairly extensive but little-known) 1990s output, to situate that later output insofar as it bears on the realism/antirealism debate, and (rather precipitously, perhaps) to identify what I take to be the single common premise of his entire philosophical work.","Univ Reading, Dept Philosophy, Reading RG6 2AA, Berks, England",University of Reading,"Preston, J (corresponding author), Univ Reading, Dept Philosophy, Reading RG6 2AA, Berks, England.",j.m.preston@reading.ac.uk,,"Preston, John/0000-0002-3740-2308",,,,,18,12,14,0,0,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

I survey the various competing views in biological systematics. These offer different explanations for what it is that makes a member of one species, family, etc. a member of that taxon.

I argue that what is really doing the explanatory work in many of these cases is a basic mechanism of information transmission, which is distinct from memetic evolution by natural selection in significant ways. Perhaps the most significant of these is that information transmission depends primarily on the interests of the users of information, rather than the reproductive interests of the informational entities-'memes'-themselves. Although my main target is memetic approaches, this argument also applies to some other, nonmemetic, theories of cultural evolution.","[Cao, Rosa] Stanford Univ, Dept Philosophy, Stanford, CA 94305 USA",Stanford University,"Cao, R (corresponding author), Stanford Univ, Dept Philosophy, Stanford, CA 94305 USA.",rosacao@stanford.edu,,,,,,,21,2,3,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

By applying this account of realization to the natural selection of melanism in rock pocket mice, I show how an alternative, formal account of realization, favored by proponents of the statistical interpretation, misses biologically important features. More generally, this paper shows how metaphysical issues about realization normally discussed in the philosophy of mind apply to debates in philosophy of biology. Thus, it is a first step toward fleshing out the oft-noted similarities between debates in these areas.","Coll William & Mary, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA",William & Mary,"Haug, MC (corresponding author), Coll William & Mary, Box 8795, Williamsburg, VA 23187 USA.",mchaug@wm.edu,,,,,,,30,7,8,0,19,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

To substantiate these arguments, I will look at models similar to those of Skyrms ( 2000) and Komarova and Niyogi ( 2004) and study their dynamical properties. My results will lend partial support to the thesis that evolution leads to communication. In general, states of partial communication may evolve with positive probability under standard evolutionary dynamics.

We describe a range of cases all involving stable equilibria actively maintained by selection. In these cases genotypic models correctly show that selection is active at the equilibrium point. In contrast, the genic models have selection disappearing at equilibrium. For deterministic models this difference makes no difference. However, once drift is added in, the two sets of models diverge in their predicted evolutionary trajectories. Thus, contrary to received wisdom on this matter, the two sets of models are not empirically equivalent.

In this paper we consider this accusation and use it as an explanation for why the two most prominent 'wholesale' arguments in the literature seem irresolvable. Framed probabilistically, we can see very clearly why realists and anti-realists have been talking past one another. We then formulate a dilemma for advocates of either argument, answer potential objections to our criticism, discuss what remains (if anything) of these two major arguments, and then speculate about a future philosophy of science freed from these two arguments. In so doing, we connect the point about base rates to the wholesale/retail distinction; we believe it hints at an answer of how to distinguish profitable from unprofitable realism debates.

The inductive inferences of science are grounded in matters of fact that hold only in particular domains, so that all inductive inference is local. Some are so localized as to defy familiar characterization. Since inductive inference schemas are underwritten by facts, we can assess and control the inductive risk taken in an induction by investigating the warrant for its underwriting facts. In learning more facts, we extend our inductive reach by supplying more localized inductive inference schemes. Since a material theory no longer separates the factual and schematic parts of an induction, it proves not to be vulnerable to Hume's problem of the justification of induction.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Norton, JD (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",,,,,,,,31,154,182,0,8,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Thus, gold but not jewelry is a real kind. However, by such a criterion, few if any kinds or systems of classification employed in the social science are real, for the social sciences offer, at best, only restricted generalizations. Thus, according to conventional wisdom, race and class are on a par with telephone area codes and postal zones; all are nominal rather than real. I propose an account of real kinds that recognizes the current reality of race but not zip codes and shows how a kind can be both constructed and real. One virtue of such an understanding of realism is the light shed on our current practice of racial classification. Race is not a real biological kind but neither is race a myth or illusion. However, the question of whether a social kind is real is separate from whether the category is legitimate. W. E. B. Du Bois maintained that while there are no biological races, race is real and should be conserved. My aim, in this paper, is not to argue for the legitimacy or conservation of race but to defend Du Bois's idea that kinds of people can be both made up and real and provide an understanding of realism that does justice to the social sciences.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Philosophy, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Root, M (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Philosophy, 831 Walter Heller Hall,271 19th Ave S, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,,,,,,,17,87,113,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 SOUTH WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637-1603 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Most scientists regard a system property as emergent relative to properties of the system's parts if it depends upon their mode of organization-a view consistent with reduction. Emergence can be analyzed as a failure of aggregativity-a state in which the whole is nothing: more than the sum of its parts.

However, empirical evidence suggests that a group selection model of the origins of altruistic punishment may be insufficient. I argue that examining dominance hierarchies and coalition formation in chimpanzee societies suggests that the origins of altruistic punishment may be best captured by individual selection models.

We argue, however, that when species-level lineages and clade-level lineages are treated consistently according to standard cladist commitments, clade reproduction is indeed possible and clade selection is coherent if certain conditions obtain.

Since that time Whewell has been much ridiculed for this claim by critics such as J. S. Mill and Bas van Fraassen. I have argued elsewhere that, while Whewell's claim that consilience can guarantee the truth of a theory is clearly wrong, consilience is indeed quite useful as a confirmation criterion (Snyder 2005). Here I will show that, even when consilience gives evidence for a theory that turns out to be false, there is an important sense in which consilience shows that the theory has captured something correct about the natural-kind structure of the physical world. Whewell was therefore correct to claim that consilience provides a criterion of reality (Whewell [ 1847] 1967, vol. 2, 68). Consilience provides this by giving justification for the claim that we have really 'cut nature at its causal joints', to adapt Plato's famous phrase. Because of this, consilience can play a role in an argument for scientific realism.","St Johns Univ, Dept Philosophy, Jamaica, NY 11439 USA",St. John's University,"Snyder, LJ (corresponding author), St Johns Univ, Dept Philosophy, 8000 Utopia Pkwy, Jamaica, NY 11439 USA.",snyderl@stjohns.edu,,,,,,,43,7,8,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

This paper introduces Barsalou's theory of perceptual symbols and explores its implications for philosophy of science. If perceptual symbols lie in the heart of conceptual processing, the process of attribute selection during concept representation, which is critical for defining similarity and thus for comparing taxonomies, can no longer be determined solely by background beliefs. The analogous nature of perceptual symbols and the spatial nature of intraconceptual relations impose new constraints on attribute selection. These constraints help people with different background beliefs select compatible attributes, which constitute a common platform for taxonomy comparison.","Calif Lutheran Univ, Dept Philosophy, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 USA",California Lutheran University,"Chen, X (corresponding author), Calif Lutheran Univ, Dept Philosophy, Thousand Oaks, CA 91360 USA.",chenxi@clunet.edu,,,,,,,19,0,0,1,1,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Recently several groups of investigators have begun to tie together the behavior of the organism and the underlying genes, neural circuits, and molecular processes implemented in those circuits. Behavior is quintessentially organismal-it is the organism as a whole that moves and mates-but the explanations are devised at the molecular and neurocircuit levels, and tested in populations using protocols that span many levels of aggregation. Following a brief review of the main relevant features of C, elegans, I describe some of these circuits, and then discuss two contrasting approaches in behavioral genetics and neural network analysis of the worm.

I argue that the alternative interpretation is legitimately individualistic on the grounds that it accurately reflects the actual taxonomic practices of bona fide individualistic sciences. The classification of homeobox genes in developmental genetics provides an illustration. When applied to the taxonomy of psychological kinds, alternative individualism has some surprising consequences. In particular, externalist taxonomies of thought are consistent with the alternative interpretation, and hence consistent with individualism.

But in the context of scientific research, how seriously should we really take this threat of multiple realizability? By examining how brain areas are identified in neuroscience (where the approach is comparative and employs functional criteria), we show that the skepticism about neuroscience's role in understanding cognition is misguided and that the apparent success of multiple realizability is based on methodological error. With respect to the former point, we develop and analyze a representative case in which the organization of the brain provides crucial information about the organization of the cognitive system. Then we show that the initial plausibility of claims to multiple realizability rest on (a) mismatching a broad-grained criterion (to show sameness of psychological states) with a fine-grained criterion (to differentiate brain states), and (b) a failure to attend to the purposes for which taxonomies of brain and psychological states are developed.","Washington Univ, Dept Philosophy, Philosophy Neurosci Psychol Program, St Louis, MO 63130 USA; Univ Cent Florida, Dept Philosophy, Orlando, FL 32816 USA",Washington University (WUSTL); State University System of Florida; University of Central Florida,"Bechtel, W (corresponding author), Washington Univ, Dept Philosophy, Philosophy Neurosci Psychol Program, Campus Box 1073, St Louis, MO 63130 USA.",,"Bechtel, William/L-3989-2019",,,,,,52,253,281,0,7,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 SOUTH WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637-1603 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Despite the fact that Freud never empirically established that these implications hold, the 'tally argument' does draw attention to a critical distinction that is too often neglected in contemporary empirical studies of psychoanalysis and other forms of psychotherapy: between empirical evaluations of the efficacy of psychotherapy and empirical evaluations of theoretical explanations of the efficacy of psychotherapy, and the different forms of comparative enquiry relevant to each. It is argued that the contemporary neglect of this critical distinction, in conjunction with the common negative conception of placebo control treatments in psychotherapy research, has led to the epistemic impoverishment of experimental studies of the various professional psychotherapies. In consequence, although there is good empirical evidence for the efficacy of psychoanalysis and other forms of professional psychotherapy, there is no good empirical evidence for theoretical psychoanalytic explanations of the efficacy of psychoanalysis, or for traditional theoretical explanations of the efficacy of other forms of professional psychotherapy.","CUNY, DEPT PSYCHOL, NEW YORK, NY 10031 USA",City University of New York (CUNY) System,"Greenwood, JD (corresponding author), CUNY, DEPT PHILOSOPHY, 138TH ST & CONVENT AVE, NEW YORK, NY 10031 USA.",,,,,,,,49,7,10,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Each is defined and briefly illustrated with an example from the geosciences. I argue that model-filtered data are typically more accurate and reliable than so-called raw data and, hence, beneficially serve the epistemic aims of science.","[Bokulich, Alisa] Boston Univ, Dept Philosophy, 745 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA",Boston University,"Bokulich, A (corresponding author), Boston Univ, Dept Philosophy, 745 Commonwealth Ave, Boston, MA 02215 USA.",abokulic@bu.edu,,,"European Union COFUND Senior Research Fellowship, under EU grant [609412]","European Union COFUND Senior Research Fellowship, under EU grant","This article was written while I was a visiting researcher at the Institute for Advanced Study at Durham University, and I gratefully acknowledge the financial support of the European Union COFUND Senior Research Fellowship, under EU grant 609412.

Recently, Richard Prum has defended Darwin's idea that the evolution of sexual displays is driven by arbitrary and nonadaptive preferences of potential mates. Prum argues that this explanation should be the null model for sexual selection research. I show that if we adopted Prum's proposal, the inferences we could be justified in making are more modest than he claims.

The quantum theory of atoms in molecules, developed by Richard F. W. Bader and colleagues, seeks to define bonding using a topological analysis of the electron density distribution. The bond paths identified by the analysis are posited as indicators of a special pair-wise physical relationship between atoms. While elements of the theory remain subject to debate, I argue that the quantum theory of atoms in molecules embodies a distinctive interactive conception of bonding that is an attractive alternative to others previously discussed.","[Esser, Stephen] Univ Penn, 433 Cohen Hall,249 S 36th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA",University of Pennsylvania,"Esser, S (corresponding author), Univ Penn, 433 Cohen Hall,249 S 36th St, Philadelphia, PA 19104 USA.",sesser@sas.upenn.edu,,,,,,,21,12,12,1,13,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Viewed from this perspective, it is argued that a crucial concern with the current framework for addressing the curve fitting problem is, on the one hand, the undue influence of the mathematical approximation perspective, and on the other, the insufficient attention paid to the statistical modeling aspects of the problem. Using goodness-of-fit as the primary criterion for 'best', the mathematical approximation perspective undermines the reliability of inference objective by giving rise to selection rules which pay insufficient attention to 'accounting for the regularities in the data'. A more appropriate framework is offered by the error-statistical approach, where (i) statistical adequacy provides the criterion for assessing when a curve captures the regularities in the data adequately, and (ii) the relevant error probabilities can be used to assess the reliability of inductive inference. Broadly speaking, the fittest curve (statistically adequate) is not determined by the smallness if its residuals, tempered by simplicity or other pragmatic criteria, but by the nonsystematic (e.g. white noise) nature of its residuals. The advocated error-statistical arguments are illustrated by comparing the Kepler and Ptolemaic models on empirical grounds.","Virginia Tech 3019, Dept Econ, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University,"Spanos, A (corresponding author), Virginia Tech 3019, Dept Econ, Pamplin Hall 0316, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",aris@vt.edu,"Spanos, Aris/P-8464-2019",,,,,,28,39,40,0,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Approaching models this way accommodates many such things that working scientists themselves call models but that the semantic conception of models does not duly recognize as such. That models are epistemic artifacts implies, firstly, that they cannot be understood apart from purposeful human activity; secondly, that they are somehow materialized inhabitants of the intersubjective field of that activity; and thirdly, that they can function also as knowledge objects. We argue that models as epistemic artifacts provide knowledge in many other ways than just via direct representative links.

J,"Tennant, N",,,,"Tennant, N",,,Sex and the evolution of fair-dealing,PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Brian Skyrms has studied the evolutionary dynamics of a simple bargaining game. Fair-dealing is the strategy 'demand 1/2', competing with the more modest strategy 'demand 1/3' and the greedier strategy 'demand 2/3'. Individuals leave offspring in proportion to their accumulated payoffs. The rules for payoffs from encounters penalize low- and high-demanders. The result is a significant basin of attraction for fair-dealing as an evolutionarily stable strategy. From these considerations Skyrms concludes that a disposition to fair-dealing could have evolved. A very different picture emerges, however, when one considers genetic bases for the dispositions involved. A simple two-allele sexual model produces very different stable equilibria in the distribution of behavioral phenotypes. The equilibria for Skyrms's purely phenotypic selection process will not in general be attainable once one enters some simple genetic considerations.","Ohio State Univ, Dept Philosophy, Columbus, OH 43210 USA",University System of Ohio; Ohio State University,"Tennant, N (corresponding author), Ohio State Univ, Dept Philosophy, 230 N Oval Mall, Columbus, OH 43210 USA.",,,,,,,,9,7,8,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

I demonstrate how insights from multiscale modeling can provide a concrete mathematical interpretation of downward causation as boundary conditions for models used to represent processes at lower scales. The autonomy and role of macroscale parameters and higher-level constraints are illustrated through examples of multiscale modeling in physics, developmental biology, and systems biology. Drawing on these examples, I defend the explanatory importance of constraining relations for understanding the behavior of biological systems.","[Green, Sara] Univ Copenhagen, Sect Hist & Philosophy Sci, Dept Sci Educ, Oster Voldgade 3, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark",University of Copenhagen,"Green, S (corresponding author), Univ Copenhagen, Sect Hist & Philosophy Sci, Dept Sci Educ, Oster Voldgade 3, DK-1350 Copenhagen, Denmark.",sara.green@ind.ku.dk,,"Green, Sara/0000-0001-7011-7202",,,,,37,19,21,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Glennan considers mechanisms to be an interaction of parts, where the interaction between parts can be characterized by direct, invariant, change-relating generalizations. Machamer, Darden, and Craver criticize traditional conceptualizations of mechanisms which are based solely on parts interacting and introduce a new concept-activity. This essay is an attempt at carving out a relationship between these two philosophical interpretations of a mechanism.

The synthesis produces an analysis of specifically mechanistic role functions, one that uses the characteristic active, spatial, temporal, and hierarchical organization of mechanisms to add precision and content to Cummins' original suggestion.

I suggest that most (if not all) theories incorporate, or depend on, one or more idealizing assumptions. I then argue that such theories ought to be regimented as counterfactuals, the antecedents of which are simplifying assumptions. If this account of the logical form of theories is granted, then a serious problem arises for Bayesians concerning the prior probabilities of theories that have counterfactual form. If no such probabilities can be assigned, then posterior probabilities will be undefined, as the latter are defined in terms of the former. I argue here that the most plausible attempts to address the problem of probabilities of conditionals fail to help Bayesians, and, hence, that Bayesians are faced with a new problem. In so far as these proposed solutions fail, I argue that Bayesians must give up Bayesianism or accept the counterintuitive view that no theories that incorporate any idealizations have ever really been confirmed to any extent whatsoever. Moreover, as it appears that the latter horn of this dilemma is highly implausible, we are left with the conclusion that Bayesianism should be rejected, at least as it stands.","Univ N Carolina, Dept Philosophy & Religion, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA",University of North Carolina; University of North Carolina Wilmington,"Shaffer, MJ (corresponding author), Univ N Carolina, Dept Philosophy & Religion, Wilmington, NC 28403 USA.",,,,,,,,66,7,9,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Saidel (1994) has argued that Owens' argument illegitimately individuates the contents of folk psychological states widely and causal powers narrowly. He suggests that causal powers may well be wide, and that the conditions that militate in favor of wide content also militate in favor of wide causal powers; mutatis mutandis for narrow content and narrow causal powers. I argue that these suggestions are in error, and hence that Saidel's criticism is ineffective.

But Lipton's account of explanation makes an adequate explanation depend on a principle which is virtually identical to Mill's Method of Difference. This has the result of collapsing IBE on Lipton's account of it into causal inference as conceived by the Causal-Inference model of induction. According to this model, many of our inductions are inferences from effects to their probable causes, and Mill's Methods are canons to guide such inferences. Thus, Lipton's account of IBE fails to represent an advance over the already familiar Causal-Inference Model of induction.",,,"Rappaport, S (corresponding author), DE ANZA COLL,DEPT PHILOSOPHY,CUPERTINO,CA 95014, USA.",,,,,,,,9,14,17,0,2,PHILOSOPHY SCI ASSN,E LANSING,"MICHIGAN STATE UNIV-DEPT PHIL 18 MORRILL HALL, E LANSING, MI 48824",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

J,"Bradley, R",,,,"Bradley, R",,,Radical probabilism and Bayesian conditioning,PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,JEFFREY CONDITIONALIZATION; KINEMATICS; BELIEF,"Richard Jeffrey espoused an antifoundationalist variant of Bayesian thinking that he termed 'Radical Probabilism'. Radical Probabilism denies both the existence of an ideal, unbiased starting point for our attempts to learn about the world and the dogma of classical Bayesianism that the only justified change of belief is one based on the learning of certainties. Probabilistic judgment is basic and irreducible. Bayesian conditioning is appropriate when interaction with the environment yields new certainty of belief in some proposition but leaves one's conditional beliefs untouched (the 'Rigidity' condition). Although Richard Jeffrey denied the general applicability of this condition, one of his main contributions to probabilistic thinking is a form of belief updatingnow typically called 'Jeffrey conditioning' or 'probability kinematics'-that is appropriate in circumstances in which Rigidity is satisfied, but where the interaction causes one to reevaluate one's probability judgments over some partition of the possibility space without conferring certainty on any particular element. The most familiar occasion for Jeffrey conditioning is receipt of uncertain evidence: things partially perceived or remembered. But it also serves to illuminate belief updating occasioned by a change in one's degrees of conditional belief, a kind of belief change largely ignored by classical Bayesianism. I argue that such changes in conditional belief can also be basic (in the sense of not being analyzable as a consequence of conditioning on factual information) and offer a kinematical model for a particular kind change in conditional belief. Both are applied to changes in preference. Finally, I argue that Rigidity can fail when changes of belief give inferential grounds for changes in conditional belief (and vice versa). These failures show that conditioning methods are properly regarded, not as valid rules of inference, but as tools in the 'art of judgment'.","Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Philosophy Logic & Sci Methods, London WC2A 2AE, England",University of London; London School Economics & Political Science,"Bradley, R (corresponding author), Univ London London Sch Econ & Polit Sci, Dept Philosophy Logic & Sci Methods, Houghton St, London WC2A 2AE, England.",R.Bradley@lse.ac.uk,,"Bradley, Richard/0000-0003-2184-7844",,,,,18,50,56,0,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

While phylogenetic information can be useful for testing adaptive hypotheses in humans, these generally involve traits that are (a) not widely shared in the species or (b) fairly widely shared in the Hominidae family, and hence likely of a lower order of complexity than the sorts of traits evolutionary psychology has so far been interested in.","Univ Tennessee, Dept Philosophy, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA",University of Tennessee System; University of Tennessee Knoxville,"Kaplan, JM (corresponding author), Univ Tennessee, Dept Philosophy, 801 McClung Tower, Knoxville, TN 37996 USA.",jkaplan@utk.edu,,,,,,,52,18,20,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

In a recent article Shanks and Joplin analyze and find wanting the use of irreducible complexity as a marker for intelligent design. Their primary counterexample is the Belousov-Zhabotinsky reaction, a self-organizing system in which competing reaction pathways result in a chemical oscillator. In place of irreducible complexity they offer the idea of redundant complexity, meaning that biochemical pathways overlap so that a loss of one or even several components can be accommodated without complete loss of function. Here I note that complexity is a quantitative property, so that conclusions we draw will be affected by how well-matched the components of a system are. I also show that not all biochemical systems are redundant.

The problem is then traced back to the TD characterization of phase transitions, and it turns out that the characterization is the result of serious idealizations which under suitable circumstances approximate actual conditions.","Univ Florida, Dept Philosophy, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida,"Liu, C (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Philosophy, 330 Griffin Floyd Hall,POB 118545, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",cliu@phil.ufl.edu,,,,,,,18,38,41,0,3,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

One reason for this is that it is useful to model these systems using aggregates and statistical relationships. The issue I deal with here is the way R. A. Fisher used the model of an ideal gas as a methodological device for examining the causal role of selection in producing variation in Mendelian populations. The model enabled him to create the kind of population where one could measure the effects of selection in a way that could not be done empirically. Consequently we are able to see how the model of an ideal gas was transformed into a biological model that functioned as an instrument for both investigating nature and developing a new theory of genetics.,"Univ Toronto, Trinity Coll, Dept Philosophy, Toronto, ON M5S 1H8, Canada",University of Toronto,"Morrison, M (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Trinity Coll, Dept Philosophy, Toronto, ON M5S 1H8, Canada.",,,,,,,,6,10,11,0,3,PHILOSOPHY SCI ASSN,E LANSING,"MICHIGAN STATE UNIV-DEPT PHIL 18 MORRILL HALL, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

The derivation of critical exponents proceeds via a real-space or a field-theoretic approach to the RG.

If complex emotions like guilt, shame and romantic jealousy are largely culturally determined, how could they be biological adaptations? Dual inheritance models of gene/culture coevolution provide a potential answer to this question. If complex emotions are developmentally 'scaffolded' by norms that are transmitted from parent to offspring with reasonably high fidelity, then these emotions can evolve to promote individual reproductive interests. This paper draws on case studies of emotional development to illustrate how complex emotions satisfy these conditions. Many of the norms and parenting strategies influencing emotional development are absorbed during the early stages of life when a child is in primary contact with its parents and before the onset of complex cognition. These conditions make it likely that emotion-governing norms are transmitted vertically and with relatively little cognitive 'contamination'.","Univ Queensland, Dept Philosophy, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia",University of Queensland,"Linquist, S (corresponding author), Univ Queensland, Dept Philosophy, Brisbane, Qld 4072, Australia.",s.linquist@uq.edu.au,,,,,,,12,3,5,1,8,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

This paper argues that they are not. Defining rationality solely in terms of theories' comparative problem-solving strengths, comparativist philosophers of science like Laudan subscribe to what I call the irrelevance claim (IC) and the necessity claim (NC). According to IC, a scientific theory's being well or poorly confirmed is '' irrelevant '' to its acceptance; NC is the claim that '' all evaluations of research traditions and theories must be made within a comparative context,'' how any theory '' compares with its competitors '' (Laudan 1977, 21, 120). Using current competing theories (T1 and T2) of population viability assessment (PVA) for the Florida panther, the paper investigates IC/NC. In part because dominant T2 panther biologists accept IC/NC (which T1 theorists reject), the paper argues that they appear both to have accepted flawed T2 and to have contributed to flawed panther science and policy. Correcting Laudan's Comparativist Philosophy of Science (LCPS), underlying the T1-versus- T2 debate, thus may hold promise for helping resolve both the scientific and policy controversy over panther PVA.","Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA; Univ Notre Dame, Dept Philosophy, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame; University of Notre Dame,"Shrader-Frechette, K (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Biol Sci, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",kshrader@nd.edu,,,,,,,34,1,1,0,9,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Expansion seems required by DST's argument against privileging genes in evolutionary and developmental explanations of organic traits. DST and the expanded replicator brook no distinction between biological and cultural evolution. However, by endorsing a single expanded unit of inheritance and leaving the classical molecular notion of gene intact, DST achieves only a nominal reunification of heredity and development. I argue that an alternative conceptualization of inheritance denies the classical opposition of genetics and development while avoiding the singularity inherent in the replicator concept. It also yields a new unit-the reproducer-which genuinely integrates genetic and developmental perspectives. The reproducer concept articulates the non-separability of genetic and developmental roles in units of heredity, development, and evolution.

He also claims that when we regiment scientific papers correctly, we can see that the hypothetico-deductive method, Baysian induction, and inference to the best explanation fail to capture the structure of scientific articles adequately. In what follows I demonstrate that the coding scheme Suppe used for uncovering the structure of a scientific paper is not appropriate under all circumstances, illustrate alternative structures found in various scientific articles, and show that the hypothetico-deductive method can accommodate the alternative structures I find. My conclusions are that the article that Suppe analyzed is not paradigmatic of published scientific articles, that different papers have different structures, that the structure depends upon the rhetorical goals of the article, and that, because of the different structures and different goals, no one philosophical account of testing is going to suffice.","Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Philosophy, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA; Univ Cincinnati, Dept Philosophy, Cincinnati, OH 45221 USA",Virginia Polytechnic Institute & State University; University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati,"Hardcastle, VG (corresponding author), Virginia Polytech Inst & State Univ, Dept Philosophy, Blacksburg, VA 24061 USA.",,,,,,,,13,3,4,0,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 SOUTH WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637-1603 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

This example is closer to home than those typically discussed within philosophy of biology. I apply evolutionary and immunological accounts of organismality to the counting question: How many organisms are present during a placental pregnancy? I conclude that an evolutionary approach yields the answer two, because of bottlenecking, germ-soma sequestration, and sexual recombination. By contrast, an immunological approach answers one, because of pervasive interactions across the placenta. This analysis expands and refines recent work on a biologically informed metaphysics of pregnancy, an undertheorized area of philosophy of science.","[Grose, Jonathan] Univ Southampton, Fac Arts & Humanities, Dept Philosophy, Ave Campus, Southampton SO17 1BF, Hants, England",University of Southampton,"Grose, J (corresponding author), Univ Southampton, Fac Arts & Humanities, Dept Philosophy, Ave Campus, Southampton SO17 1BF, Hants, England.",j.n.grose@soton.ac.uk,,,European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program [679586]; European Research Council (ERC) [679586] Funding Source: European Research Council (ERC),European Research Council under the European Union's Horizon 2020 research and innovation program(European Research Council (ERC)); European Research Council (ERC)(European Research Council (ERC)),"I thank members of the BUMP project group-Teresa Baron, Suki Finn, Alex Geddes, Elselijn Kingma, Anne Sophie Meincke, and Ziggy Schilpzand-for very helpful comments on versions of this manuscript.

I demonstrate that the divergence between their predictions is a function of standard techniques used in their analysis and of differences in the idealizations involved in each.

RSC must be sharply distinguished from structural versions that assume a further identity of 'models' and 'structures', which we reject.

This article begins to fill this gap by considering what species concepts, if any, apply neatly to the bacterial world. First, I argue that the biological species concept cannot be applied to bacteria because of the variable rates of genetic transfer between populations, depending in part on which gene type is prioritized. Second, I present a critique of phylogenetic bacterial species, arguing that phylogenetic bacterial classification requires a questionable metaphysical commitment to the existence of essential genes. I conclude by considering how microbiologists have dealt with these biological complexities by using more pragmatic and not exclusively evolutionary accounts of species. I argue that this pragmatism is not borne of laziness but rather of the substantial conceptual problems in classifying bacteria based on any evolutionary standard.","Columbia Univ, Dept Philosophy, New York, NY 10027 USA",Columbia University,"Franklin, LR (corresponding author), Columbia Univ, Dept Philosophy, 708 Philosophy Hall,1150 Amsterdam Ave, New York, NY 10027 USA.",lrf2001@columbia.edu,,,,,,,61,36,44,0,7,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

These are illustrated using classic work on blood types by Cavalli-Sforza and his collaborators in the Parma Valley of Italy, in which the theoretically predicted patterns are exhibited in human populations. These data and the models display properties of ensembles of populations. The explanatory problem needs to be understood in terms of how likely an observed change, in either a population or an ensemble, would be under drift alone; this is fundamentally a matter of chance.

An examination of two popular measures of incremental confirmation suggests the view that one should stick to incrementally well confirmed theories, because incremental confirmation takes one to (the most) informative (among all) true theories. However, incremental confirmation does not further this goal in general.

The claim is that homeostatic mechanisms acting on the members of such taxa nonetheless ensure a significant cluster of similarities. The HPC theorist's focus on individual similarities is inadequate to account for stable polymorphism within taxa, and fails properly to capture their historical nature. A better approach is to treat distributions of traits in species populations as irreducible facts, explained in terms of selection pressures, genealogy, and other evolutionary factors. We call this view Population Structure Theory (PST).

Contra Leda Cosmides and John Tooby, Fodor argues (i) there is no reason to think that human cognition is a Darwinian adaptation in the first place, and (ii) there is no valid inference from adaptationism about the mind to massive modularity. However, Fodor maintains (iii) that there is a valid inference in the converse direction, from modularity to adaptationism, but (iv) that the language module is an exception to the validity of this inference. I explore Fodor's arguments for each of these claims, and the interrelations between them. I argue that Fodor is incorrect on point (i), correct on point (ii), partially correct on point (iii), and incorrect on point (iv).

In molecular biology (MB), by contrast, individual persons remain the primary epistemic subjects. Using Ed Hutchins' (1995) account of navigation aboard a traditional US Navy ship as a prototype, I argue that both HEP and MB exhibit forms of distributed cognition. That is, in both fields cognition is distributed across individual persons and complex artifacts. The cognitive system producing the knowledge is heterogeneous. Nevertheless, in both fields we can reserve epistemic agency for the human components of these systems. We do not need to postulate new distributed cognitive agents, let alone ones exhibiting new forms of consciousness.","Univ Minnesota, Dept Philosophy, Ctr Philosophy Sci, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA",University of Minnesota System; University of Minnesota Twin Cities,"Giere, RN (corresponding author), Univ Minnesota, Dept Philosophy, Ctr Philosophy Sci, 831 Heller Hall, Minneapolis, MN 55455 USA.",,,,,,,,4,60,75,0,7,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

The analysis of an important part of physical practice-abstraction-shows, however, that laws describe the behavior of physical systems under very special circumstances, namely when they are isolated. Nevertheless, laws are applied in. cases of non-isolation as well. This practice requires an explanation. It is argued that one has to assume that physical systems have dispositions. I take these to be innocuous from an empiricist's standpoint because they can-at least in principle-be measured. Laws can be applied whenever such a disposition is present, they describe how the physical system would behave if the disposition were manifest.","Univ Bielefeld, Abt Philosophie, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany",University of Bielefeld,"Hüttemann, A (corresponding author), Univ Bielefeld, Abt Philosophie, Postfach 100131, D-33501 Bielefeld, Germany.",,,"Huttemann, Andreas/0000-0003-0646-3092",,,,,14,27,28,0,0,PHILOSOPHY SCI ASSN,E LANSING,"MICHIGAN STATE UNIV-DEPT PHIL 18 MORRILL HALL, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Thus, the quantum chaos question is a prime subject for philosophical analysis. The most significant reasons given for the absence or suppression of chaotic behavior in. quantum models are the linearity of Schrodinger's equation and the unitarity of the time-evolution described by that equation. Both are shown in this essay to be irrelevant by demonstrating that the crucial feature for chaos is the nonseparability of the Hamiltonian. That demonstration indicates that quantum! chaos is likely to be exhibited in models of open quantum systems. A measure for probing such models for chaotic behavior is developed, and then used to show that quantum mechanics has chaotic models for systems having a continuous energy spectrum. The prospects of this result for vindicating the essence of the correspondence principle are then briefly examined.","Univ Texas, Dept Philosophy, Austin, TX 78712 USA",University of Texas System; University of Texas Austin,"Kronz, FM (corresponding author), Univ Texas, Dept Philosophy, Austin, TX 78712 USA.",,,,,,,,73,9,9,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

(1) Dutch Book arguments are reformulated so that their independence from utility and preference in epistemic contexts is evident. (2) The Bayesian analysis of the Quine-Duhem problem is pursued; the phenomenon of a protective belt of auxiliary statements around reasonably successful theories is explicated. (3) The Bayesian approach to understanding the superiority of variety of evidence is pursued; a recent challenge (by Wayne) is converted into a positive result on behalf of the Bayesian analysis, potentially with far-reaching consequences. (4) The condition for applying the merger-of-opinion results and the thesis of underdetermination of theories are compared, revealing significant limitations in applicability of the former.

A case from optimality theory is presented and interpreted as a microreductive explanation of fitness difference. Such microreductions can have considerable scope.

Focusing on electromagnetic duality, which is a simple example of S-duality in string theory, I show that the duality fits naturally into at least one framework for assessing equivalence-that of categorical equivalence-but that it fails to meet a necessary condition for equivalence on that account. The reason is that the duality does not preserve empirical content in the required sense; instead, it takes models to models with dual empirical content. I conclude by discussing how one might react to this.","[Owen Weatherall, James] Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Log & Philosophy Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA",University of California System; University of California Irvine,"Weatherall, JO (corresponding author), Univ Calif Irvine, Dept Log & Philosophy Sci, Irvine, CA 92697 USA.",weatherj@uci.edu,"Weatherall, James/AAF-7065-2020",,John Templeton Foundation [61048],John Templeton Foundation,"I am grateful to Seb de Haro, for organizing the session in which this article was presented, and to my cosymposiasts, Thomas Barrett, Seb de Haro, and Laurenz Hudetz, for a lively and interesting session.

The effective complexity of a string as a purely formal construct, lacking a physical interpretation, is either close to zero, or equal to the string's algorithmic complexity, or arbitrary, depending on the auxiliary criterion chosen to pick out the regular component of the string.

Peirce argued that, besides deduction and induction, there is a third mode of inference which he called hypothesis or abduction. He characterized abduction as reasoning from effect to cause, and as the operation of adopting an explanatory hypothesis. Peirce's ideas about abduction, which are related also to historically earlier accounts of heuristic reasoning (the method of analysis), have been seen as providing a logic of scientific discovery. Alternatively, abduction is interpreted as giving reasons for pursuing a hypothesis. Inference to the best explanation (IBE) has also been regarded as an important mode of justification, both in everyday life, detective stories, and science. In particular, scientific realism has been defended by an abductive no-miracle argument (Smart, Putnam, Boyd), while the critics of realism have attempted to show that this appeal to abduction is question-begging, circular, or incoherent (Fine, Laudan, van Fraassen). This paper approaches these issues by distinguishing weaker and stronger forms of abduction, and by showing how these types of inferences can be given Peircean and Bayesian probabilistic reconstructions.","Univ Helsinki, Dept Philosophy, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland",University of Helsinki,"Niiniluoto, I (corresponding author), Univ Helsinki, Dept Philosophy, FIN-00014 Helsinki, Finland.",ilkka.niiniluoto@helsinki.fi,,,,,,,50,154,181,2,27,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

This paper generates a puzzle for law theorists, causal theorists and inductivists alike. Intractability can force scientists to use a semi-empirical method, in which some of an equation's theoretically-determinable parameters are replaced with values taken directly from the data. This is not a purely deductive or inductive process, nor does it involve causes and capacities in any simple way (Humphreys 1995). I argue the predictive successes of such methods require us to reanalyze our views about the nature of prediction, the status of models, and the goal(s) of science. When laws and experimental evidence are neither individually nor jointly sufficient for prediction, models become the locus of understanding. I analyze an historically important debate about the use of semi-empirical methods to construct potential energy surfaces.","Oregon State Univ, Dept Philosophy, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA",Oregon State University,"Ramsey, JL (corresponding author), Oregon State Univ, Dept Philosophy, Corvallis, OR 97331 USA.",,,,,,,,84,11,12,0,1,PHILOSOPHY SCI ASSN,E LANSING,"MICHIGAN STATE UNIV-DEPT PHIL 18 MORRILL HALL, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Both science and cognitive development involve abstract, coherent systems of entities and rules, theories. In both cases, theories provide predictions, explanations, and interpretations.

J,"Levy, A",,,,"Levy, Arnon",,,Models and Fictions: Not So Similar after All?,PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"A number of philosophers draw a close analogy between scientific modeling and fiction, often appealing to Kendall Walton's make-believe view.

More specifically, I argue that, on the one hand, the appeal to Walton is appropriate inasmuch as his view fits well with how modelers employ the imagination.

While constructivists acknowledge there is a biological dimension to emotion, they deny that emotions are (or involve) affect programs. So they also deny emotions are natural kinds. However, the essential role that constructivism gives to felt experience and folk concepts leads to an account that is extensionally inadequate and functionally inaccurate. Moreover, biologically oriented proposals that reject these commitments are not similarly encumbered. Recognizing this has two implications: biological mechanisms are more central to emotion than constructivism allows, and the conclusion that emotions are not natural kinds is premature.","[Kurth, Charlie] Western Michigan Univ, Dept Philosophy, 1903 W Michigan Ave,Mail Stop 5328, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA",Western Michigan University,"Kurth, C (corresponding author), Western Michigan Univ, Dept Philosophy, 1903 W Michigan Ave,Mail Stop 5328, Kalamazoo, MI 49008 USA.",charles.kurth@wmich.edu,,,,,,,19,3,4,0,13,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Building on the work of Darden and Maull, Kitcher, and Kincaid, I treat unity as a relationship between fields: two fields become more integrated as the number and/or significance of interfield connections grow. Even when reduction fails, two theories or fields can be unified (integrated) in significant ways. I highlight two largely independent dimensions of unification. Fields are theoretically unified to the extent that we understand how the ontologies, concepts, and generalizations of these fields are connected. (Reductionism is one form of theoretical unity, but not the only form). Fields are practically unified through heuristic connections (e.g., using the heuristics of one field to generate hypotheses in another field) and by the development of methods for integrating the qualitatively distinct bodies of data generated by the two fields. I discuss the relationship between paleontological and neontological systematics to illustrate the utility of conceptualizing unity as interconnection.","Coll Charleston, Dept Philosophy & Religious Studies, Charleston, SC 29424 USA; Univ Chicago, Chicago, IL 60637 USA",College of Charleston; University of Chicago,"Grantham, TA (corresponding author), Coll Charleston, Dept Philosophy & Religious Studies, 66 George St, Charleston, SC 29424 USA.",granthamt@cofc.edu,,,,,,,44,50,63,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

J,"Tanona, S",,,,"Tanona, S",,,The anticipation of necessity: Kant on Kepler's laws and universal gravitation,PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Kant's views on the epistemological status of physical science provide an important example of how a philosophical system can be applied to understand the foundation of scientific theories. Michael Friedman has made considerable progress towards elucidating Kant's philosophy of science; in particular, he has argued that Kant viewed Newton's law of universal gravitation as necessary for the possibility of experiencing what Kant called true motion, which is more than the mere relative motion of appearances but is different from Newton's concept of absolute motion. In this context, Friedman has provided an account of how Kant must have viewed Newton's supposed derivation of universal gravitation from Kepler's laws, based on, among other things, Kant's claim that Newton really needed to make extra assumptions in order to derive universal gravitation. In this paper, I argue that Friedman's account is incomplete for three reasons. First, Friedman has overlooked an important aspect of how Newton's third law is applied in the relevant sections of the Principia; as a result, Friedman's account partially misconstrues the relation between the planetary phenomena and the theory of universal gravitation. Second, his account fails to account for Kant's apparent belief that Kepler's laws are only empirically-based rules, even though they seem to be necessary for the derivation of universal gravitation and hence also necessary for Kant's own definition of true motion. Third, Friedman has overlooked some remarks by Kant that indicate that Kant thought the crucial properties of universal gravitation could be known without reference to the empirically determined motions of the planets and hence seemingly without any help from Newton.","Indiana Univ, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA",Indiana University System; Indiana University Bloomington,"Tanona, S (corresponding author), Indiana Univ, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Goodbody Hall 130, Bloomington, IN 47405 USA.",,,,,,,,9,2,4,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Nevertheless, inflationary cosmology remains a promising research program, not least because it offers an explanation of the origin of the density perturbations that seeded the formation of galaxies and other cosmic structures.

The issue is, how is innateness defined in biology? Some critics contend that innateness is not a legitimate concept in biology. In this paper I will argue that it is. However, neither the concept of high heritability nor the concept of flat norm of reaction (two popular accounts in the biology literature) define innateness. An adequate account is found in developmental biology. I propose that innateness is best defined in terms of C. H.

The time asymmetry of these phenomena therefore plausibly arises from a time asymmetry of counterfactual dependence. But why is counterfactual dependence time asymmetric? The most influential account of the time asymmetry of counterfactual dependence is David Albert's account, which posits a new, time-asymmetric fundamental physical law, the so-called past hypothesis. Albert argues that the time asymmetry of counterfactual dependence arises from holding fixed the past hypothesis when evaluating counterfactuals. In this article, I argue that Albert's account misconstrues the time asymmetry of counterfactual dependence.","[Loew, Christian] Univ Luxembourg, Inst Philosophy, L-4366 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg",University of Luxembourg,"Loew, C (corresponding author), Univ Luxembourg, Inst Philosophy, L-4366 Esch Sur Alzette, Luxembourg.",christian.loew@uni.lu,,"Loew, Christian/0000-0003-4051-2476",,,,,27,1,2,0,6,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

J,"Shackel, N",,,,"Shackel, Nicholas",,,Bertrand's paradox and the principle of indifference,PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"The principle of indifference is supposed to suffice for the rational assignation of probabilities to possibilities. Bertrand advances a probability problem, now known as his paradox, to which the principle is supposed to apply; yet, just because the problem is ill-posed in a technical sense, applying it leads to a contradiction. Examining an ambiguity in the notion of an ill-posed problem shows that there are precisely two strategies for resolving the paradox: the distinction strategy and the well-posing strategy. The main contenders for resolving the paradox, Marinoff and Jaynes, offer solutions which exemplify these two strategies. I show that Marinoff's attempt at the distinction strategy fails, and I offer a general refutation of this strategy. The situation for the well-posing strategy is more complex. Careful formulation of the paradox within measure theory shows that one of Bertrand's original three options can be ruled out but also shows that piecemeal attempts at the well-posing strategy will not succeed. What is required is an appeal to general principle. I show that Jaynes's use of such a principle, the symmetry requirement, fails to resolve the paradox; that a notion of metaindifference also fails; and that, while the well-posing strategy may not be conclusively refutable, there is no reason to think that it can succeed. So the current situation is this. The failure of Marinoff's and Jaynes's solutions means that the paradox remains unresolved, and of the only two strategies for resolution, one is refuted and we have no reason to think the other will succeed. Consequently, Bertrand's paradox continues to stand in refutation of the principle of indifference.","Univ Oxford, Fac Philosophy, Oxford OX1 4JJ, England",University of Oxford,"Shackel, N (corresponding author), Univ Oxford, Fac Philosophy, 10 Merton St, Oxford OX1 4JJ, England.",nicholas.shackel@philosophy.ox.ac.uk,,"Shackel, Nicholas/0000-0002-1751-1400",,,,,12,47,55,0,4,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

On the positive side, I argue that (1) the confirmation of realism requires explaining theories' explanatory success, not just their predictive success; (2) in turn this task requires a richer realist model of explanation that brings into the explanans both (a) successful theories' epistemic virtues (e. g., unification and simplicity) and (b) the standards governing these virtues, as well as truth; (3) this richer realist model is further confirmed because it can better explain the success of theories in gaining wide acceptance among scientists; and (4) the model is further supported because it is superior to `preservative realism' in providing a plausible rebuttal of the pessimistic meta-induction from the many past successful-but-false theories to the likelihood that our best current theories are likewise false.","Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Philosophy, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA",University of California System; University of California San Diego,"Doppelt, G (corresponding author), Univ Calif San Diego, Dept Philosophy, 9500 Gilman Dr, La Jolla, CA 92093 USA.",jdoppelt@ucsd.edu,,,,,,,15,29,33,0,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

The first counterexample that I examine involves a time-wise gerrymandered world line of a series of patches of wall that is absorbing energy as a result of being illuminated in an astrodome. Salmon says that since the gerrymandered world line does not fulfill his no-interaction requirement, his CQ theory does not suffer from the counterexample. But I will argue that his response fails both at a theoretical level and at a practical level. In so doing I point out a problem for CQ theorists' definition of a causal interaction. The second counterexample is concerned with a time-wise gerrymandered world line of a series of patches that are in shadow, in Hitchcock's well-known example. Salmon's response is based on a principle that Salmon thinks is derivable from the concept of a conserved quantity. However, I argue that the principle has a counterexample.","Seoul Natl Univ, Programs Hist & Philosophy Sci, Coll Nat Sci, Kwanak Gu, Seoul 151742, South Korea",Seoul National University (SNU),"Choi, SH (corresponding author), Seoul Natl Univ, Programs Hist & Philosophy Sci, Coll Nat Sci, Kwanak Gu, San 56-1,Sillim Dong, Seoul 151742, South Korea.",,,,,,,,8,5,6,0,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Ordinary speakers would explicitly (and sincerely) deny having these rather esoteric beliefs about language-e.g., the belief that an anaphor must be bound in its governing category. Such ascriptions can also seem problematic in light of certain theoretical considerations having to do with concept possession, revisability, and so on. Nonetheless, we argue that ordinary speakers believe the propositions expressed by certain sentences of linguistic theory, and that linguistics can therefore teach us something about belief as well as language. Rather than insisting that ordinary speakers lack the linguistic beliefs in question, philosophers should try to show how these empirically motivated belief ascriptions can be correct. We argue that Stalnaker's (1984) ''pragmatic'' account-according to which beliefs are dispositions, and propositions are sets of possible worlds-does just this. Moreover, our construal of explanation in linguistics motivates (and helps provide) responses to two difficulties for the pragmatic account of belief: the phenomenon of opacity, and the so-called problem of deduction.",,,"Dwyer, S (corresponding author), MCGILL UNIV,DEPT PHILOSOPHY,855 SHERBROOKE ST W,MONTREAL,PQ H3A 2T7,CANADA.",,,,,,,,29,21,23,0,3,PHILOSOPHY SCI ASSN,E LANSING,"MICHIGAN STATE UNIV-DEPT PHIL 18 MORRILL HALL, E LANSING, MI 48824",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

I argue that the patient's risk is interpreted ontically, as a propensity.

Moreover, natural selection and drift can then be viewed as two aspects of probability distributions over frequencies in populations of organisms.

In this paper I discuss whether phenomenological communities are functionally structured, causal systems that play a role in determining the presence and abundance of organisms in a local habitat patch. I argue they are not, if individualist models of community assembly are vindicated; i.e., if the presence of one species is not typically explained by the presence or absence of specific other species. I discuss two alternatives to individualism, and conclude by arguing for a dimensional model of phenomenological communities. The causal salience of a phenomenological community depends on three factors: the extent to which it is internally regulated, the extent to which it has robust boundaries, and the extent to which it has emergent properties. I conclude by using this model to frame a natural research agenda for community ecology.","Victoria Univ Wellington, Philosophy Program, Wellington, New Zealand",Victoria University Wellington,"Sterelny, K (corresponding author), Victoria Univ Wellington, Philosophy Program, POB 600, Wellington, New Zealand.",kimbo@coombs.anu.edu.au,,"Sterelny, Kim/0000-0003-3159-6698",,,,,32,30,38,0,12,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Second, a familiar problem for classical reductionism resurfaces within this newest wave of thinking, a problem that is exacerbated by Bickle's conciliatory treatment of property plasticity and the subsequent intertheoretic cross-classification of terms. Third, Bickle's interesting response to cross-classification via Hooker's function-to-structure token reduction has virtually nothing to do with token reduction and everything to do with eliminative materialism.","N Carolina State Univ, Dept Philosophy & Relig, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA; Arkansas State Univ, Dept Philosophy, State Univ, AR 72467 USA",North Carolina State University; Arkansas State University,"Endicott, R (corresponding author), N Carolina State Univ, Dept Philosophy & Relig, Campus Box 8103, Raleigh, NC 27695 USA.",,,,,,,,33,10,12,0,3,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Then came the mechanics of Newton's Principia, which seemed to manage quite well without appealing to hypothesis (though much would depend on how exactly terms like force and attraction were construed). If the science of motion could dispense with causal hypothesis and the attendant uncertainty, why should this not serve as the goal of natural philosophy generally? The apparent absence of causal hypothesis from the highly successful new science of motion went far towards shaping, in different ways, the account of scientific knowledge given by many of the philosophers of the century following, notable among them Berkeley, Hume, Reid, and Kant. This Newtonian interlude in the history of the philosophy of science would today be accounted on the whole a byway. The Principia, despite its enormous achievement in shaping subsequent work in mechanics, was from the beginning too idiosyncratic from an epistemic standpoint to serve as model for the natural sciences generally.","Univ Notre Dame, Dept Philosophy, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA",University of Notre Dame,"McMullin, E (corresponding author), Univ Notre Dame, Dept Philosophy, 336-7 OShaughnessy, Notre Dame, IN 46556 USA.",ERNAN.MCMULLIN.1@ND.EDU,,,,,,,52,38,48,0,17,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

The organism is pulled in divergent directions: on the one hand, there is an important body of work that emphasizes the role of the gene in development, as executing and controlling embryological change; on the other hand, there are more theoretical approaches under which the organism disappears as little more than an instance for testing biological generalizations. I press here for the ineliminability of the organism in developmental biology on explanatory grounds. I examine classical work concerned with growth and development, particularly in Drosophila and C. elegans. Some of this work is suggestive of modular development, and accordingly suggests a level below that of the organism as being explanatory. These are not the only type of case. There are other equally well-established results, which indicate greater integration in the developing organism. Though with a modular organization the organism can be thought of as made up of its constituent traits, and though the explanations of these traits may lie in terms of cells or genes, even with modular development the explanations of genetic differences require an appeal to the organism. With non-modular organization the organism has an even more central role. This does not mean that these genetic or cellular contributions are unreal in any way, or that development requires some sort of vitalistic contribution; but the genetic contributions make sense only as constituents of the organism, embedded in a larger organic context.","Univ Cincinnati, Dept Philosophy, Cincinnati, OH 45211 USA",University System of Ohio; University of Cincinnati,"Richardson, RC (corresponding author), Univ Cincinnati, Dept Philosophy, Cincinnati, OH 45211 USA.",,,,,,,,15,3,3,0,1,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 SOUTH WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637-1603 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

However, it is well known that the fine-grained entropy remains constant under the Hamiltonian flow. In this paper it is argued that we need not search for alternatives for fine-grained entropy, nor do we have to reject Hamiltonian dynamics, in order to solve the problem of the constancy of fine-grained entropy and, more generally, to account for the non-equilibrium part of the laws of thermodynamics. Rather, we have to weaken the requirement that equilibrium be identified with a stationary probability distribution.","Univ Utrecht, Inst Hist & Fdn Math & Sci, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, Netherlands",Utrecht University,"van Lith, J (corresponding author), Univ Utrecht, Inst Hist & Fdn Math & Sci, POB 80000, NL-3508 TA Utrecht, Netherlands.",,,,,,,,7,8,8,0,1,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"5720 SOUTH WOODLAWN AVE, CHICAGO, IL 60637-1603 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

J,"Garson, J",,,,"Garson, Justin",,,There Are No Ahistorical Theories of Function,PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Theories of function are conventionally divided up into historical and ahistorical ones. Proponents of ahistorical theories often cite the ahistoricity of their accounts as a major virtue. Here, I argue that none of the mainstream ahistorical accounts are actually ahistorical.

In particular, I argue that there are different ways in which models are used to ask and answer questions about the dynamics of evolutionary change, prospectively and retrospectively, in classical versus molecular evolutionary genetics. Further, I argue that robustness analysis is a tool for, if not confirmation, then something near enough, in this discipline.","Univ Utah, Dept Philosophy, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA",Utah System of Higher Education; University of Utah,"Plutynski, A (corresponding author), Univ Utah, Dept Philosophy, 260 S Cent Campus Dr,Rm 341, Salt Lake City, UT 84112 USA.",plutynski@philosophy.utah.edu,,"Plutynski, Anya/0000-0003-3791-7720",,,,,16,11,14,0,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

To the contrary, he was confronted with observations that could have led him to a more '' evo- devo '' understanding of the emergence of novel features. Indeed, since Morgan was an embryologist before he became a fruit-fly geneticist, one would have predicted that the combination of these two lines of research would have resulted in early formulations of concepts relevant to evolutionary developmental biology. It is thus of interest to review Morgan's thought processes and arguments for at first rejecting both Darwinism and Mendelism, and then for later dismissing data that would have yielded a model of rapid morphological change in favor of a model of change based on the accumulation of minor mutations and their morphological consequences.","Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Anthropol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA; Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Hist & Philosophy Sci, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA",Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh; Pennsylvania Commonwealth System of Higher Education (PCSHE); University of Pittsburgh,"Schwartz, JH (corresponding author), Univ Pittsburgh, Dept Anthropol, Pittsburgh, PA 15260 USA.",jhs@pitt.edu,,,,,,,32,4,4,0,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

On Kuhn's view of conceptual conflict, the scientist's appeal to philosophical principles is an obvious symptom of incommensurability; philosophical preferences are merely subjective factors that play a part in the necessarily circular arguments that scientists offer for their own conceptual commitments. Recent work by Friedman has persuasively challenged this view, revealing the roles that philosophical concerns have played in preparing the way for conceptual change, creating an enlarged conceptual space in which alternatives to the prevailing framework become intelligible and can be rationally discussed. If we shift our focus from philosophical themes or preferences to the process of philosophical analysis, however, we can see philosophy in a different and much more significant historic role: not merely as an external source of general heuristic principles and new conceptual possibilities, but, at least in the most important revolutionary developments, as an objective tool of scientific inquiry. I suggest that this approach offers some insight into the philosophical significance of Newton's and Einstein's revolutionary work in physics, and of the interpretation of their work by (respectively) Kant and the logical positivists. It also offers insight into the connections between modern philosophy of science and some traditional philosophical concerns about the nature of a priori knowledge.","Univ Western Ontario, Dept Philosophy, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"DiSalle, R (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, Dept Philosophy, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",,,,,,,,27,9,13,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Moreover, on our present understanding of what it is to be a physically reasonable field, the standard energy conditions are violated classically.

Neither attempt succeeds, though as I argue, both leave their mark. In the first two sections of the paper I introduce some conceptual difficulties for the tensed theory of time. The next section then discusses the standing of tenses in light of special relativity, especially recent work by Stein on the topic. I argue that, Stein's possibility theorem notwithstanding, special relativity is inconsistent with philosophically interesting conception of tense. Finally, I search for help for tenses in the broader context of quantum theory, Lorentzian interpretations of time dilation/length contraction, and general relativistic spacetimes.

Two interesting possibilities are (i) that Chi and classical chaos are included in and underwritten by quantum mechanics (BM) or (ii) that BM and CM simply possess a common region of (noninclusive) overlap. In the latter case, neither CM nor QM alone would be sufficient, even in principle, to account for all of the physical phenomena we encounter.

This approach is, indeed, incomplete, in that it neglects the role of the hypothesis under consideration in determining what diversity in a body of evidence is relevant diversity.

I address this question by exploring the relation between two debates: Is natural selection a mechanism? Is natural selection a causal or a statistical theory? I argue that the first can be assessed only relative to a model and that, following the second, there are two fundamentally different and independent kinds of models, Modern-Synthesis and Darwinian models.

The second argument points out that the explanandum and the explanans are phenomena at different levels: selection is a population-level phenomenon, whereas adaptation occurs on the individual level. Thus, selection can explain why individuals in a certain population have a certain trait, but it cannot explain why a certain individual has this trait.

J,"Myrvold, W",,,,"Myrvold, W",,,The quantum mechanics of minds and worlds.,PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE,,,English,Book Review,,,,,,,,"This book is a discussion of the Everett relative-state interpretation of quantum mechanics and related no collapse interpretations. The book presumes that its readers will have some familiarity with quantum mechanics and with the interpretational issues connected with it. It would be suitable for use in an introductory graduate course on the philosophy of quantum mechanics, although even experts are likely to enjoy its clear summaries of-the material in its purview. The. Dirac-von Neumann collapse postulate, which has it, that a quantum system undergoes a state transition upon measurement that is radically different from the continuous, linear, deterministic evolution it undergoes at all other times, has long been regarded as problematic. One of the problems to which it gives rise is the measurement problem, the problem of explaining what it is that distinguishes measurements from other physical interactions. If the collapse postulate is rejected, however, we are faced with the problem of accounting for determinate outcomes of experiments, as opposed to the superpositions of outcomes to which the linear, unitary Schrodinger evolution would typically lead. Rejection of the collapse postulate seems to entail regarding the quantum-mechanical state description as incomplete; as Bell put it, Either the wave function, as given by the Schrodinger equation, is not everything, or it is not right (Bell 1987, 201). As is well-known, Hugh Everett III (1957 a, b) proposed an interpretation that, if successful, would avoid both horns of Bell's dilemma. On Everett's proposal, the quantum-mechanical state vector yields a complete account of physical reality, and it obeys the Schrodinger dynamics at all times. Reactions to this proposal haven included both perfunctory dismissal and uncritical acceptance. Barrett's book finds the Aristotelian mean between these two opposing vices-it offers a sympathetic account of the Everett interpretation and related no collapse interpretations that nevertheless does not turn a blind eye to their shortcomings. After a brief introduction to quantum mechanics and a historical account of the incorporation of the collapse postulate into what has become the standard formulation of quantum mechanics, there follows a close reading of Everett's own presentation of his theory, a reading that, if nothing else, makes it abundantly clear just how ambiguous Everett's account is. Barrett goes on to survey some of the more interesting examples of theories' that purport either to be elucidations of Everett's interpretation or to he improvements on Everett's interpretation; what these theories have in common is the claim that the Schrodinger evolution holds at all times. Some of these theories hold, with Everett, that the quantum mechanical state description is complete; others add extra quantities to pick out a distinguished branch of a superposition. In the former class are what Albert (1992) calls the bare theory, the many-worlds interpretations, and approaches that attempt to base determinacy of experience on environmentally induced decoherence; in the latter class fall the single-mind and many-minds theories of Albert and Loewer (1988), as well as the Bohm theory (one might add that the various modal interpretations belong in this class, also; although these are mentioned at various points in the book, discussions of the often intricate details of modal interpretations is beyond its scope). Any interpretation of quantum mechanics, or any theory that takes quantum mechanics as its starting point, is deserving of our serious consideration to an extent that cannot exceed the extent to which quantum mechanics itself is so deserving. This, in turn, is based on the empirical success of quantum mechanics; the evidence that quantum mechanics may have something to tell us about the way the world is lies in experimental results and in records of such results. Any theory that tells us that experiments do not, in fact, have determinate outcomes, and that we do not have determinate records of experimental outcomes, is self-undermining (even if the theory also explains why we falsely believe that we have such records) because, if the theory is true, we could have no evidence that the theory is true. Barrett calls such self-undermining empirical incoherence. According to Barrett, it is on grounds of empirical incoherence that the bare theory and many-worlds interpretation ultimately fail. Since much of our evidence for quantum mechanics is statistical in nature, a particularly acute symptom of empirical incoherence lies in the difficulty of interpreting the Born-rule probabilities on no-collapse theories, or at least on the no-frills variety that refrains from adding extra structure to the quantum-mechanical state description. The problem is not, as some advocates of such theories seem to think, one of obtaining the correct probabilities in a non-circular way; it is a problem of finding something for the probabilities to be probabilities of Quantum-mechanical probabilities are standardly interpreted as probabilities that this or that possible outcome will be the result of a specified measurement, given a specified preparation procedure. If the result of a measurement interaction is, with certainty, a superposition of what we usually regard as the possible out-comes-interpreted as a splitting of worlds, or not-then (as Barrett puts it), Whence probability? (163). This point has, of course, been made before, but it is one that bears repeating, as advocates of Everett-style interpretations continue to attempt to side-step it. The quest for empirical coherence is a recurring theme throughout the book, and this is one of its strengths-when Barrett rejects an interpretation as inadequate, this is done not on the basis of violations of a set of prejudices labeled intuitions, but on the grounds that the interpretation undermines the very reasons we might have for seriously considering it. The lesson that interpretations of quantum mechanics are to be taken seriously only insofar as we have evidence that quantum mechanics is correct can, perhaps, be taken further than Barrett takes it, to indicate that we should also seriously consider theories that modify the quantum dynamics. As Abner Shimony has remarked, in view of the fact that the experimental confirmation of that dynamics is almost entirely based on the behaviour of microscopic systems [...] it is very hazardous indeed to extrapolate the validity of that dynamics to the universe as a whole (Shimony 1989: 393, quoted by Barrett: 156). Barrett's book is an exploration of the consequences of such an extrapolation that clearly reveals some of the hazards the extrapolation faces. Although the book does not pretend to decide between the horns of Bell's dilemma, it makes it abundantly clear that the attempt to evade both horns does not succeed.","Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada",Western University (University of Western Ontario),"Myrvold, W (corresponding author), Univ Western Ontario, London, ON N6A 3K7, Canada.",,"Myrvold, Wendy/H-8277-2013",,,,,,7,1,1,0,7,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Superselection accounts of measurement all have in common a decision to represent the indicator states of detectors by eigenspaces of superselection operators named in a superselection rule, on the grounds that the states in question are states of a so-called classical quantity and therefore not subject to quantum interference effects. By this strategy superselectionists of measurement expect to dispense with use of projection postulates in treatments of measurement.

BST faces the problem of how to measure a trait's joint effect on survival and reproduction in its account of function.

However, Batterman misidentifies the reason that RG explanations are noncausal: it is not the case that an explanation is noncausal if it ignores causal details. I propose an alternative argument, according to which RG explanations are noncausal explanations because their explanatory power is due to the application of mathematical operations, which do not serve the purpose of representing causal relations.","Univ Munich, Munich Ctr Math Philosophy, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Reutlinger, A (corresponding author), Univ Munich, Munich Ctr Math Philosophy, Ludwigstr 31, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",Alexander.Reutlinger@lrz.uni-muenchen.de,,,,,,,24,24,29,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

In it, Putnam claims that the positivists' influence led to an inflated dichotomy, rather than distinction, between descriptive sentences and evaluative sentences. He argues that such a dichotomy is unwarranted through a number of arguments intended to show that attempts to disentangle facts from values always fail. However, in the process Putnam overlooks a number of interesting motives underlying the positivist movement, and disregards a now-enormous body of literature in the philosophy of science on descriptive and evaluative statements. Hence, his attempt, towards the end of the collection, to construct a viable philosophy of language that can support the dichotomy's collapse and an ethical theory that can support his discussion of the dichotomy's collapse appears somewhat weak. Nevertheless, Putnam engages his philosophical discussion with contemporary economic theory in order to motivate his central claim: that taking a somewhat interesting distinction between facts and values and inflating it into a dichotomy can, and often does, lead to disastrous policy decisions. Thus, the collection shines by highlighting real-world, practical and ethical consequences of certain philosophical and theoretical commitments.","GF Philosophy, New York, NY 10003 USA",,"Angelides, A (corresponding author), GF Philosophy, Box 96,65 5th Ave, New York, NY 10003 USA.",angeA952@newschool.edu,,,,,,,6,1,2,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Using the IASP definition of 'pain' (1986) as our guide, we raise a number of questions about the philosophical assumptions underlying the scientific study of pain. We argue that unlike the study of ordinary perception, the study of pain focuses from the very start on the experience itself and its qualities, without making deep assumptions about whether pain experiences are perceptual. This in turn puts scientific explanation in a curious position due to pain's inherently subjective epistemic nature. The reason for this focus on the experience itself and its qualities, we argue, has to do with pain's complex phenomenology involving an affective/motivational dimension. We argue for the scientific legitimacy of first-person phenomenological studies and attempts to correlate phenomenology with neural events. We argue that this methodological procedure is inevitable and has no anti-physicalist ontological implications when properly understood. We end the paper by commenting on a discussion between two prominent pain scientists in the field, Don Price and Howard Fields, about the need to distinguish more dimensions in the phenomenology of pain and how to classify them vis-a-vis the recent scientific findings. Our interest in this discussion is not only to introduce some clarifications but also to show how neuro-phenomenology has already been shaping the scientific research and to back our claim about why this methodology is inevitable with an example.","Univ Florida, Dept Philosophy, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA; Duke Univ, Dept Philosophy, Durham, NC 27708 USA",State University System of Florida; University of Florida; Duke University,"Aydede, M (corresponding author), Univ Florida, Dept Philosophy, 330 Griffin Floyd Hall,Box 118545, Gainesville, FL 32611 USA.",maydede@phil.ufl.edu,,,,,,,46,17,24,0,4,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Are the sciences that constitute cognitive science independent and theoretically autonomous, or is there a necessary interaction between them? I explore Fodor's Multiple Realization Thesis (MRT) which starts with the fact of multiple realization and purports to derive the theoretical autonomy of special sciences (such as psychology) from structural sciences (such as neurobiology). After laying out the MRT, it is shown that, on closer inspection, the argument is either circular or self-undermining-the argument either assumes the very autonomy it seeks to demonstrate or the concluded autonomy is contradicted by the theoretical interdependence invoked by the premises of the argument. Next, I explore a concrete example of multiple realization in the explanation of animal behavior: the convergent evolution of jamming avoidance behaviors in three genera of weakly electric fish. Contrary to the image painted by the MRT, the work on these animals involves a high degree of interaction between the various levels of investigation. The fact that our understanding of electric fish behavior involves functional theories and multiple realization without the kind of disunified science that is supposed to follow from such a situation indicates that the mere fact of multiple realization cannot be the basis for an autonomous psychology.","Pitzer Coll, Claremont, CA 91711 USA",Claremont Colleges; Pitzer College,"Keeley, BL (corresponding author), Pitzer Coll, 1050 N Mills Ave, Claremont, CA 91711 USA.",keeley@twinearth.wustl.edu,,,,,,,44,23,24,0,2,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,CAMBRIDGE,"EDINBURGH BLDG, SHAFTESBURY RD, CB2 8RU CAMBRIDGE, ENGLAND",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Dynamic causal models clarify how doing so reveals a system's nonequilibrium causal relationships. Here I use these models to elucidate the idealizations and abstractions involved in representing a system at a timescale. The models reveal that key features of causal representations-such as which variables are exogenous-may vary with the timescale at which a system is considered. This has implications for debates regarding which systems can be represented causally.,"[Weinberger, Naftali] Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich Ctr Math Philosophy, Ludwigstr 31, D-80539 Munich, Germany",University of Munich,"Weinberger, N (corresponding author), Ludwig Maximilians Univ Munchen, Munich Ctr Math Philosophy, Ludwigstr 31, D-80539 Munich, Germany.",naftali.weinberger@gmail.com,,"Weinberger, Naftali/0000-0002-4011-5756",Pittsburgh Center for Philosophy of Science; Humboldt Foundation,Pittsburgh Center for Philosophy of Science; Humboldt Foundation(Alexander von Humboldt Foundation),"Thanks to JimWoodward, Lauren Ross, and Ken Kendler for inviting me to participate in the PSA colloquium Strategies for Dealing with Causal Complexity.

In this vein, I highlight the ubiquity of conceptual and material questions in research, arguing that replication has its place but is not as central to psychological research as it is sometimes taken to be.","[Feest, Uljana] Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Philosophie, Moore 21, D-30167 Hannover, Germany",Leibniz University Hannover,"Feest, U (corresponding author), Leibniz Univ Hannover, Inst Philosophie, Moore 21, D-30167 Hannover, Germany.",feest@philos.uni-hannover.de,"feest, uliana/AAO-6686-2021",,,,,,25,53,63,0,15,CAMBRIDGE UNIV PRESS,NEW YORK,"32 AVENUE OF THE AMERICAS, NEW YORK, NY 10013-2473 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

In section 3 we develop a revised version of TCN, called TCN*, which accounts for interactive causes.

As such, any other interpretation that treats the state vector as representing real ontological features of a system can explain quantum speedup too.","Univ Montana, Dept Philosophy, Missoula, MT 59812 USA",University of Montana System; University of Montana,"Duwell, A (corresponding author), Univ Montana, Dept Philosophy, Liberal Arts 101, Missoula, MT 59812 USA.",armond.duwell@umontana.edu,"Duwell, Armond/MTD-9760-2025",,,,,,6,5,6,0,5,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

(Q2) How can we account for the explanatory import of function-ascribing statements? This paper addresses these questions through a modified version of Cummins' functional analysis. The modification in question is concerned with phylogenetical restrictions on causal role functions, and it stems from an analysis of some primary areas in molecular biology. I examine how evolutionary consideration affects the so-called 'function-analytical explanatory strategy' (Cummins [1975] 1998, 2002). Finally, I argue that the neo-functional analysis here proposed accounts for a certain convergence between the main rival theories of biological function.","Univ Rijeka, Dept Philosophy, Rijeka 51000, Croatia",University of Rijeka,"Sustar, P (corresponding author), Univ Rijeka, Dept Philosophy, Omladinska 14, Rijeka 51000, Croatia.",ira.rechner@gradr.hr,"Sustar, Predrag/S-4514-2018","Sustar, Predrag/0000-0002-6375-2424",,,,,34,6,7,0,2,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

J,"Morrison, M",,,,"Morrison, Margaret",,,Where have all the theories gone?,PHILOSOPHY OF SCIENCE,,,English,Article,,,,,,,,"Although the recent emphasis on models in philosophy of science has been an important development, the consequence has been a shift away from more traditional notions of theory. Because the semantic view defines theories as families of models and because much of the literature on scientific modeling has emphasized various degrees of independence from theory, little attention has been paid to the role that theory has in articulating scientific knowledge. This paper is the beginning of what I hope will be a redress of the imbalance. I begin with a discussion of some of the difficulties faced by various formulations of the semantic view not only with respect to their account of models but also with their definition of a theory. From there I go on to articulate reasons why a notion of theory is necessary for capturing the structure of scientific knowledge and how one might go about formulating such a notion in terms of different levels of representation and explanation. The context for my discussion is the BCS account of superconductivity, a 'theory' that was, and still is, sometimes referred to as a 'model'. BCS provides a nice focus for the discussion because it illuminates various features of the theory/model relationship that seem to require a robust notion of theory that is not easily captured by the semantic account.","Univ Toronto, Trinity Coll, Dept Philosophy, Toronto, ON M5S 1H8, Canada",University of Toronto,"Morrison, M (corresponding author), Univ Toronto, Trinity Coll, Dept Philosophy, Toronto, ON M5S 1H8, Canada.",mmorris@chass.utoronto.ca,,,,,,,42,39,54,0,7,UNIV CHICAGO PRESS,CHICAGO,"1427 E 60TH ST, CHICAGO, IL 60637-2954 USA",0031-8248,1539-767X,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.

Single cell recording, imaging studies, and the study of neurological deficits all feed into the Gallian view that different brain areas do different things and the things being done are confined to particular processing streams. At the same time, there is a growing sentiment that brains probably don't work like that after all; it is better to conceive of them as fundamentally distributed units, multi-tasking at every level. This sentiment, however, is much less congenial to the tried-and-true experimental protocols available today and to theorizing about the brain in general. This essay examines the tension between current experimental methods and large-scale views of the brain.

First, I argue that explanatorily relevant information is not always information about causes, even in cases where the explanandum has an identifiable causal history. Second, I argue that treating theoretical explanations as reductions from general causal laws does not accurately describe the types of top-down explanations typical of dynamical modeling.

It is our contention that whenever the flight to reference strategy is invoked, there is a crucial step that is left undefended, and that without a defense of this step, the flight to reference is a fatally flawed strategy; it cannot succeed in resolving philosophical issues. In this paper we begin by setting out the flight to reference strategy and explaining what is wrong with arguments that invoke the strategy.

In view of the no-go theorems for non-contextual hidden variable theories already existing up to 1964, and due to Gleason and Bell, one is forced to acknowledge the contextual character of the hidden variable theory which the Bell 1964 theorem refers to. Both the mathematical and the physical justifications of this contextualism are reconsidered. Consequently, the role of contextualism in recent no-hidden-variables proofs and the import of these proofs are investigated. With reference to the physical intuition underlying contextualism, the possibility is considered whether a context-dependence of individual measurement results is compatible with context-independence of the statistics of measurement results.","Univ Florence, Dipartimento Filosofia, I-50139 Florence, Italy",University of Florence,"Laudisa, F (corresponding author), Univ Florence, Dipartimento Filosofia, Via Bolognese 52, I-50139 Florence, Italy.",,,"LAUDISA, FEDERICO/0000-0003-2919-8084",,,,,26,8,8,0,0,PHILOSOPHY SCI ASSN,E LANSING,"MICHIGAN STATE UNIV-DEPT PHIL 18 MORRILL HALL, E LANSING, MI 48824 USA",0031-8248,,,PHILOS SCI,Philos.
